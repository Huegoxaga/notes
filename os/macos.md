### zsh

- `Zsh` is the macOS default shell for its terminal. It is similar to `bash` but has the following difference.
- set `Zsh` as the default shell, run `chsh -s /bin/zsh` then restart the terminal.
- set `bash` as the default shell,run `chsh -s /bin/bash` then restart the terminal.
- The startup config files for `zsh`:
  - `.zshenv` is always sourced.
  - `.zprofile` is sourced before `.zshrc`
  - `.zshrc` is for interactive(non-login, sub-shell) shell configuration.
  - `.zlogin` is sourced on the start of a login shell after `.zshrc`.
  - `.zlogout` is sourced upon exiting.
- The startup config files can be created in the `/etc` folder or the `~/` folder.
  - Startup config files in `/etc` folder will be ran for all users.
  - Startup config files in `/~` folder will overwrite the same file in `/etc`.
- `/etc/.zprofile` uses `/usr/libexec/path_helper` to load paths.
  - `path_helper` load path text file in the `/etc/.paths` file and `/etc/paths.d` folder for command.
  - `path_helper` load path text file in the `/etc/.manpaths` file and `/etc/manpaths.d` folder for command maunals.
- run `manpath` to see all the command maunals text file path.
