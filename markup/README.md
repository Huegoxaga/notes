# Markup Language

- A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document.
- It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.
- While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are:
  - [HTML](html.md)
  - [XML](xml.md)

## Markdown Language

- Markdown is a library that generates HTML markup.
  - [Github Flavored Markdown](gfm.md)

## LaTeX

- It provides a way to represent Math formula when using LaTeX supported editors.
- See more details [here](latex.md).
