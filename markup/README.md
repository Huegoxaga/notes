# Markup Language
* A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document.
* It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax.
* While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are:
  * [HTML](https://huegoxaga.github.io/notes/markup/html.html)
  * [XML](https://huegoxaga.github.io/notes/markup/xml.html)
