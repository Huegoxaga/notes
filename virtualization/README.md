# Virtualization

## Virtual Machines

- Allows you to run an operating system within its window directly on top of your existing operating system.
- The OSâ€™s contained in these windows are referred to as virtual machines(VMs).
- The physical computer is then typically referred to as the host, while the virtual machine is typically referred to as a guest OS.
- The guest OS thinks it's running on real hardware as the only OS with exclusive use of all hardware resources.
- Virtualization software configures and creates the virtual environment, redirect hardware access to simulated hardware files.
- It utilizes hypervisor to host multiple VMs runnung different operating systems.
  - Type 2 hypervisor - a software running on a host operationg system.
  - Type 1 hypervisor - a bare-metal installation.

### VMs Platforms

## Containers Platforms

- Containers on Linux are similar to VMs, but they do not use hypervisor and add libraries on top of host OS with guest OS.
- Each isolated container using namespace. The isolation is not as strong as using hypervisor.
  - A namespace is a Linux Kernel feature that isolate processes in the same system environment.
  - There are 7 types namespaces in Linux System.
    - Ex, namespaces for User, IPC, PID...
  - one namespace can have one or more containers.
- Container on Windows machines use `Hyper-V` or can running on `Windows 10 64bit Home Insider Preview build 19018+`.
- Each container needs to be deployed on Container Runtime services. It lies between host OS and containers.
- Container focuses on running a certain software inside, with its filesystem, CPU, memory, process space, and more.
- Containers are lightweight and flexible.
- Container Providers
  - [Docker](https://huegoxaga.github.io/notes/virtualization/kubernetes.html)

## Container Orchestration

- Container orchestration is the automatic process of managing or scheduling the work of individual containers for applications based on microservices within multiple clusters.
- Container Orchestration Tools
  - Docker Compose
  - [Kubernetes](https://huegoxaga.github.io/notes/virtualization/kubernetes.html)
