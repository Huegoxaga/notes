# Virtualization

## Virtual Machines
* Allows you to run an operating system within its own window directly on top of your existing operating system.
* The OSâ€™s contained in these windows are referred to as virtual machines(VMs).
* The physical computer is then typically referred to as the host, while the virtual machine is typically referred to as a guest OS.
* The guest OS thinks it's running on real hardware as the only OS with exclusive use of all hardware resources.
* Virtualization software configures and creates the virtual environment, redirect hardware access to simulated hardware files.

## Containers Platforms
* Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among the applications.
* Container focuses on running certain softwares inside, with its own filesystem, CPU, memory, process space, and more.
* Each container needs to be deployed on Container Runtime services, without installing and running the entire OS for every container.
* Containers are lightweight and flexible.

### Container Providers

* Kubernetes (K8s)
