## Time Value of Money

- The interest rate is the amount charged, expressed as a percentage of the principal, by a lender to a borrower for the use of assets, it is consisted of the following components:
  - Risk Premium Components - this part compensate the risk for lending, it includes:
    - Default Risk Premium - it reflects the borrower's financial status
    - Liquidity Premium - it reflects the demand of the debt covenants(which is the debt agreement or financial contracts for loans and bonds) in the market, or the cost of selling it
    - Maturity Risk Premium - the longer the term, the higher the risk
  - Risk-free Components(Nominal Risk-free Rate) - this part compensate the losses of the lender for not having the money on hand, it equals the minimum returns if the lender use the money to make any investment elsewhere. In the U.S, the interest rate of Treasury Bill (T-Bill, a short-term U.S. government debt ) is used as a benchmark for this component, it includes:
    - Inflation Premium - it guarantees the purchasing power of the money after the borrower returns the money, it matches the expect inflation rate
    - Real Risk-free Rate - this is the incentives for the lender to lend the money
- The interest rate can be called differently based on different interpretation
  - The `Required Rate of Return` for the lenders or investors
  - The interest rate can be seen as a `Discounted Rate` by discounting the future value of the total return
  - It can be treated as the `Opportunity Cost` of the current consumption of the money if not lending it
