- It is a combination of art and science, of forecasting the future price movement, that is based on an examination of the past price movements
- It works for all tradable instrucments which have prices fluctuated overtime
- Technical Analysis only focuses on the actual price movement, any consideration other than the price movement like financial reports and news are part of the fundamental analysis

    - Daily bar charts - it indicates the opening price on the left on the bar and closing price on the right
  - Candlesticks charts - it plots bars which demostrate prices bounded by the opening and closing prices and use extended lines(called shadows) to show the highest and lowest prices for a selected time frame
    - time frame can be any time intervals based on the platform software
    - Doji candles are candles that describe the same open and closing prices
    - When it has no upper and lower shadow it is called Marubozu candles
  - Heikin Ashi charts - similar to Candlesticks but it uses the midpoint of the previous candle body as open value and use the average of open-high-low-close (OHLC) of the current period as close value
    - It is the refined version of Candlesticks charts that filters out noises
- There are different types of trading each with different focuses on the time frame:

## Trend Analysis

- The trend of the price shows the relationship of demand of supply, the trend only changes when an external force is applied
- Trend can be:
  - Uptrend - the overall price has higher highs, and higher lows
  - Downtrend - the overal price has lower lows, and lower highs
  - Sideways trend - a horizontal trend during the transition period between uptrends and downtrends
- The prices alway fluctuate within a trend, short term trading can take advantages of this property
- A trend that last for 5 to 20 years is called a secular trend
- Trends can be categorized by time frame
  - Major trend - long-term trend
  - Intermediate trend - 1 to 3 months trend within the major trend
  - Minor trend - trend within one month with the intermediate trend
- Stages are determined by the transation of trends
  - Stage 1 - The sideways trend after a downtrend
    - it is a consolidation phase that can be called a accumulation phase when price increases slowly
  - Stage 2 - The uptrend after stage 1
  - Excess Phase - sometimes exists in between stage 2 and stage 3, this price suddenly rises and it is a sign of stage 3
    - Exhaustion Phase always follows the excess phase, is a sudden price drop after the excess phase
    - Excess Phase and Exhaustion Phase together, are sometimes recognized as two main parts of a stage 3
  - Stage 3 - The sideways trend after an uptrend
    - It's a consolidation phase that can be a accumulation phase if price goes up or distribution phase if price goes down
  - Stage 4 - The downtrend after stage 3
- Trendline is one of the most important tools in technical analysis
  - Join all troughs will create the trend line for an uptrend(also known as support), and join the peaks for a downtrend(also known as resistance)
    - Support or resistance are dynamic for uptrend and downtrend, when it is horizontal(sideways trendlines) it is a static support or resistance
    - Sometimes resistance can changed to a support level when price goes up, or vice versa
    - the faster the prices change the more likely the prices will break the trendlines
    - Volumn spikes drive the price to break the trendlines
  - When the price is crossing the trendline, a trend is changing
    - it can change back to the same trend but with a different slope
  - Main Trand line with longer time frame can be intersected by an internal trendline with a shorter time frame
  - It is better to use logrithmic scale for the y-asix to draw the trend line
    - the space between larger numbers are smaller
  - The points used to draw trendlines should be evenly spaced
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a hanging man pattern which is a red bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
  - The local minima can be indicated by a hammer man pattern which is a green bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the dragonfly candle
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a shooting star pattern which is a red bar with long upper shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small lower shadow in the candlesticks chart, it ususlly follows a green bar
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the gravestone candle
  - Marubozu shows confidence in growth when green and decrease when red
- Fibonacci retracement
