### Equity Investment

- Stock of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided
  - Similar to shares
- Stocks can be of different types with various rights(voting)
- Stocks can be sold publically on stock exchange
  - An IPO(Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a firm places shares on the public market for the first time
  - A company will hire an underwriter(mostly investment bank) who will help the company to sell the IPO portion of its shares publically
    - Firm Commitment - the underwriter buys all the shares available for sell first, under a guaranteed price
    - Best efforts agreement - the underwriter sells the shares on the company behave without guarantee
  - Regulatory compliance of financial disclosures and transparency is established durint IPO
  - IPO shares can only be purchased through the underwriter with some requirement
    - Primary Market is where investors purchase securities directly from the issuer, e.g. purchasing IPO
    - Secondary Markets is where daily tracsation happens after the securities go public
- A company's value, market cap, or market value in the stock exchange is determined by multiplying the outstanding stocks(number of shares available in the market) by the stock price, the cap ranges are as follows:
  - Large Cap: Greater than `$10` billion
  - Mid Cap: `$2-$10` billion
  - Small Cap: Less than `$2` billion
- The potential value of the company can be determined from its earning, public companies are required to report their earnings four times a year
- A stockbroker or broker buys and sells stocks at the direction of clients. Most buy and sell orders are now made through online discount brokers
- Supply and demand in the market determine stock price, every time the stock is traded, the price changes
- The profit of trading stocks is from buy at low and sell to high
- Short selling is a way to make profit when stock price drops, the investor borrows shares from a brokers' client and sell it to a new client at a high price, when price drops the investor purchase new shares from the market at a low price then return the shares to its original holder
  - short selling is more risky since there is no limit for price to rise, so the potential loss has no limit
- After-hours trading happens during extended hours when the major exchanges are closed, through computerized trading systems, or electronic markets
  - Not all brokers offer after-hours trading
- companies could buy back shares of their own stock, so the stock prices can increase
- A stock split is when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple new shares to boost the stock's liquidity, and lower the price of the stock
  - The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier
  - Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, combine multiple stocks into one
  - For each shareholder the total shares value on hand keep the same
- Historically, overall stock prices always recover and go up over time with an average annual return around `10%`
- A stock can be categorized by the following types:
  - Income stock - it returns a percentage of the stock prices to the holder quaterly(or monthly determined by the company)
  - Growth stock - A stock with no dividend, the company will use all its profit and the try to grow faster
  - Value stock - undervalued stocks with some dividend

  - The average volume is the average of the (daily) volumes for a specified period. e.g. `Avg. Volumn(10)` is the 10 days average, `Average Volumn(3m)` is the 3 months average
- Valuation Ratios
  - Price to Earnings(P/E) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS)
    - A lower `P/E` ratio means the stock price is undervalued
  - The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the annual EPS growth rate
    - Any PEG ratio that is smaller than 1.0 is good
  - The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a ratio that compares a company market cap to its revenue over the past 12 months
  - The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value, the book value is the total book value of all the shareholders determined when they buy the shares

    - This calculation is more conservative than the current ratio
- Debt Ratios
  - The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a companyâ€™s total liabilities by its shareholder equity
  - Interest coverage ratio can be calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense

### Bonds

- Purchasing bond is lending money to a company (or municipal), and they must pay it back with interest
- Interest payments are called coupons payments and typically issued semi-annually
- Bonds can be purchased from a broker
- Index

### Mutual Funds

- Mutual Funds collects money from individual investors and hires a manager to invest in various assets

  - When the mutual fund are used to track an index, it is called an index mutual funds. It has a lower management fee(MER or Expense Ratio)
- Mutual funds need to be purchased directly from a mutual fund company, a bank, or a broker

### Exchange Traded Funds(ETFs)

- ETFs is similar to index mutual funds and it can be exchanged like a stock with a management fee much lower than mutual funds
- When an ETF tracks a forenign market it can be either:
  - Hedged - The price of the fund is only reflected by the tracked security values
    - Extra work is required for the manager to cancel out the fluctation of the currency exchange rate, so it has a higher management fee
  - Unhedge - The price of the fund is reflected by both the tracked security values and currency exchange rate
    - It allows the investor to invest in currency exchange market at the same time, can increase diversity

### Alternative Investments

## Portfolio Management

- An investment portfolio contains a selection of investments with different weights, in order to control the risks
- Debt securities and equity securites market are negatively correlated(hedged), so investing in a combination of bonds and stocks is popular, and the portfolio can be described as the following allocation models when only considering invest in bonds and stocks:
  - An income portfolio consists primarily of dividend-paying stocks and coupon-yielding bonds where stocks takes from `0%` to `30%`
  - A balanced portfolio invests in both stocks and bonds to reduce potential volatility where stocks takes from `40%` to `60%`
  - A growth portfolio consists of mostly stocks where stocks takes from `70%` to `100%`
- A portfolio needs to be diversified to distribute risks using the following options:
  - select stocks that have different company cap size
  - select stocks that varies in types like growth stock and income stock, and location
  - select stocks from different stock exchange
  - select stocks from different sector

### Technical Analysis

- It is a combination of art and science, of forecasting the future price movement, that is based on an examination of the past price movements
- It works for all tradable instrucments which have prices fluctuated overtime
- Technical Analysis only focuses on the actual price movement, any consideration other than the price movement like financial reports and news are part of the fundamental analysis
- It is a type of quantitaive analysis, a part of fundamental analysis that doesn't rely on numbers are qualitative analysis
- The Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis
  - The market discounts everything - The final price of an aset on the market has taken everything into consideration including market psychology(Efficient Markets Hypothesis)
  - Price moves in trends - A price trend can always be identifid in a efficient and transparent market
  - History tends to repeat itself - the standing point of chart patterns analysis
- Types of charts
  - Line charts - it plots the closing price over time
    - A local maxima is called a peak, a local minima is called a trough
  - Bar charts - it plots a bar for the price action of each day, the highest daily price is at top of the bar and lowest daily price at the bottom of the bar, the bar is also colored in green and red to show the overall rise and fall
    - Daily bar charts - it indicates the opening price on the left on the bar and closing price on the right
  - Candlesticks charts - it plots bars which demostrate prices bounded by the opening and closing prices and use extended lines(called shadows) to show the highest and lowest prices for a selected time frame
    - time frame can be any time intervals based on the platform software
    - Doji candles are candles that describe the same open and closing prices
    - When it has no upper and lower shadow it is called Marubozu candles
  - Heikin Ashi charts - similar to Candlesticks but it uses the midpoint of the previous candle body as open value and use the average of open-high-low-close (OHLC) of the current period as close value
    - It is the refined version of Candlesticks charts that filters out noises
- There are different types of trading each with different focuses on the time frame:
  - Intraday Trading - Hold trades for few minutes to few hours but not overnight
    - Scalping - Hold trades for only few seconds or few minutes

#### Trend Analysis

- The trend of the price shows the relationship of demand of supply, the trend only changes when an external force is applied
- Trend can be:
  - Uptrend - the overall price has higher highs, and higher lows
  - Downtrend - the overal price has lower lows, and lower highs
  - Sideways trend - a horizontal trend during the transition period between uptrends and downtrends
- The prices alway fluctuate within a trend, short term trading can take advantages of this property
- A trend that last for 5 to 20 years is called a secular trend
- Trends can be categorized by time frame
  - Major trend - long-term trend
  - Intermediate trend - 1 to 3 months trend within the major trend
  - Minor trend - trend within one month with the intermediate trend
- Stages are determined by the transation of trends
  - Stage 1 - The sideways trend after a downtrend
    - it is a consolidation phase that can be called a accumulation phase when price increases slowly
  - Stage 2 - The uptrend after stage 1
  - Excess Phase - sometimes exists in between stage 2 and stage 3, this price suddenly rises and it is a sign of stage 3
    - Exhaustion Phase always follows the excess phase, is a sudden price drop after the excess phase
    - Excess Phase and Exhaustion Phase together, are sometimes recognized as two main parts of a stage 3
  - Stage 3 - The sideways trend after an uptrend
    - It's a consolidation phase that can be a accumulation phase if price goes up or distribution phase if price goes down
  - Stage 4 - The downtrend after stage 3
- Trendline is one of the most important tools in technical analysis
  - Join all troughs will create the trend line for an uptrend(also known as support), and join the peaks for a downtrend(also known as resistance)
    - Support or resistance are dynamic for uptrend and downtrend, when it is horizontal(sideways trendlines) it is a static support or resistance
    - Sometimes resistance can changed to a support level when price goes up, or vice versa
    - the faster the prices change the more likely the prices will break the trendlines
    - Volumn spikes drive the price to break the trendlines
  - When the price is crossing the trendline, a trend is changing
    - it can change back to the same trend but with a different slope
  - Main Trand line with longer time frame can be intersected by an internal trendline with a shorter time frame
  - It is better to use logrithmic scale for the y-asix to draw the trend line
    - the space between larger numbers are smaller
  - The points used to draw trendlines should be evenly spaced
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a hanging man pattern which is a red bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
  - The local minima can be indicated by a hammer man pattern which is a green bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the dragonfly candle
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a shooting star pattern which is a red bar with long upper shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small lower shadow in the candlesticks chart, it ususlly follows a green bar
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the gravestone candle
  - Marubozu shows confidence in growth when green and decrease when red
- Fibonacci retracement

#### Indicators

- They can be categorized as:
  - lagging indicator - it is a financial sign that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place. Therefore, lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them
  - leading indicator - it corresponds with a future movement or change in some phenomenon of interest. It helps to predict and forecast future events and trends
  - oscillator - a line graph that moves between two extremes

##### Lagging Indicator

- Moving Average - indicates changes in trend
  - It calculates and, for each day, it plots the average of all previous prices in a given time frame over the price chart
  - Exponentional moving average(EMA) is preferred, it reacts quicker to small price changes
  - Simple moving average is suitable for big time frames
  - 200 days moving average is popular
    - Bull lives above(current prices are higher than average price) the a average chart, Bear lives below(current prices are lower than average price) the a average chart
    - It can also act as a support and resistent level
  - It only provides valuable information when martket is in trend
  - The intersections between moving average charts for various length of time frame can be used to indicate turning points
- Moving Average Convergence/Divergence(MACD) - indicates changes in trend
  - It is also recognized as a momentum oscillator
  - It shows the postive or negative difference between a "fast" (short period) EMA, and a "slow" (longer period) EMA, in a bar chart
  - When the difference is positive the price goes up, otherwise, the price goes down

##### Oscillator

- The relative strength index (RSI) - It is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset
  - It can have a reading from 0 to 100, high RSI value(above 70) represents overbought,low RSI value(below 30) represents oversold
  - when above 50, it is an uptrend, when below 50, it is a downtrend
- The A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time
  - It is consisted of K line and D line ranging from 0 to 100
  - When K line cross above D line around 20, it is a buy signal
  - When K line cross below D line around 80, it is a sell signal
  - Whenever two lines falls below 20, it a signal of oversold. When two lines goes above 80, it is a signal of overbought
  - Sharpe bottom and broad top represents an uptrend and vice versa
  - Short-term market players tend to choose low settings for all variables, and vice versa

## Risks

- All investment associates with some risks
- Generally higher risks yields more profit
- Risk Types:
  - Market Risk(systematic risk from the overall market)
  - Business Risk(Bankruptcy of a certain company)
