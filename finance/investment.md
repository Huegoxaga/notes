# Financial Investment

## Securities

- A security is a financial investment with some monetary value
- It has three basic categories:
  - Equity Securities - The ownership shares of a corporation
  - Debt Securities - The majority of debt securities are loans called bonds
  - Derivative Securities - Purchasing derivative securities will grant the investor the right to trade other financial securities at pre-agreed upon terms
    - Futures contracts - A type of derivative securities that one has agreed to purchase assets(mostly commodities) for an agreed-upon price in the future
    - Stock options - A type of derivative securities that grants the right to purchase shares for a discounted price in the future
      - A call option is used to buy
      - A put option is used to sell

### Equity Investment

- Stock of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided
  - Similar to shares
- Stocks can be of different types with various rights(voting)
- Stocks can be sold publically on stock exchange
  - An IPO(Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a firm places shares on the public market for the first time
  - A company will hire an underwriter(mostly investment bank) who will help the company to sell the IPO portion of its shares publically
    - Firm Commitment - the underwriter buys all the shares available for sell first, under a guaranteed price
    - Best efforts agreement - the underwriter sells the shares on the company behave without guarantee
  - Regulatory compliance of financial disclosures and transparency is established durint IPO
  - IPO shares can only be purchased through the underwriter with some requirement
    - Primary Market is where investors purchase securities directly from the issuer, e.g. purchasing IPO
    - Secondary Markets is where daily tracsation happens after the securities go public
- A company's value, market cap, or market value in the stock exchange is determined by multiplying the outstanding stocks(number of shares available in the market) by the stock price, the cap ranges are as follows:
  - Large Cap: Greater than `$10` billion
  - Mid Cap: `$2-$10` billion
  - Small Cap: Less than `$2` billion
- The potential value of the company can be determined from its earning, public companies are required to report their earnings four times a year
- A stockbroker or broker buys and sells stocks at the direction of clients. Most buy and sell orders are now made through online discount brokers
- Broker provides two main types of account
  - Cash account - requires that all transactions must be made with available cash or long positions
  - Margin accounts - allow investors to borrow money against the value of the securities in their account
- Supply and demand in the market determine stock price, every time the stock is traded, the price changes
- The profit of trading stocks is from buy at low and sell to high
- Short selling is a way to make profit when stock price drops, the investor borrows shares from a brokers' client and sell it to a new client at a high price, when price drops the investor purchase new shares from the market at a low price then return the shares to its original holder
  - short selling is more risky since there is no limit for price to rise, so the potential loss has no limit
- After-hours trading happens during extended hours when the major exchanges are closed, through computerized trading systems, or electronic markets
  - Not all brokers offer after-hours trading
- companies could buy back shares of their own stock, so the stock prices can increase
- A stock split is when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple new shares to boost the stock's liquidity, and lower the price of the stock
  - The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier
  - Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, combine multiple stocks into one
  - For each shareholder the total shares value on hand keep the same
- Historically, overall stock prices always recover and go up over time with an average annual return around `10%`
- A stock can be categorized by the following types:
  - Income stock - it returns a percentage of the stock prices to the holder quaterly(or monthly determined by the company)
  - Growth stock - A stock with no dividend, the company will use all its profit and the try to grow faster
  - Value stock - undervalued stocks with some dividend

- Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time(often daily)
  - The average volume is the average of the (daily) volumes for a specified period. e.g. `Avg. Volumn(10)` is the 10 days average, `Average Volumn(3m)` is the 3 months average
- Valuation Ratios
  - Price to Earnings(P/E) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS)
    - A lower `P/E` ratio means the stock price is undervalued
  - The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the annual EPS growth rate
    - Any PEG ratio that is smaller than 1.0 is good
  - The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a ratio that compares a company market cap to its revenue over the past 12 months
  - The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value, the book value is the total book value of all the shareholders determined when they buy the shares
  - Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price
    - this ratio can go up when the stock price drops, since the the pay out amound keeps the same

- Liquidity Ratios
  - The current ratio is the proportion of the amount of current assets which only can be sold in one year divided by the amount of current liabilities
    - The higher the better, should be at least great than 1.0
  - The quick ratio is the proportion of the amount of current assets which only can be sold quickly exclude all the inventory divided by the amount of current liabilities
    - This calculation is more conservative than the current ratio
- Debt Ratios
  - The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a companyâ€™s total liabilities by its shareholder equity
  - Interest coverage ratio can be calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense
    - Lower than 1.0 is not good

### Fixed Income Securities

- a fixed income security is an instrument that allows a borrower to borrow money from a lender
- The most common type of fixed income security is a bond, sometimes two terms are used interchangeably
- a bond is a contractual agreement between the bond issuer and the bond holders
- Bonds can be purchased from a broker
- Index

- Total borrowing time length
- Maturity date is the date on which the principal is to be repaid once a bond has been issued
- terms to maturity can be as short as one day or as long as thirty years or more
  - money market securities bonds has original maturities of one year or less
  - capital market securities has original maturities of more than one year
  - perpetual bonds don't have a maturity date
- The time remaining until maturity is referred to as the term to maturity or tenor of a bond, it make periodic interest payments but do not promise to repay the principal amount

##### Par value

- the principal amount that will be repaid at maturity
- It is also referred to as the face value, maturity value, redemption value or principal value of a bond
- bonds prices are commonly quoted as a percentage of par(e.g. bonds qouted as 105 has price which is 105% of the par value)
- a bond that is selling for more than its par value is said to be trading at a premium to par
- a bond that is selling at less than its par value is said to be trading at a discount to par
- a bond that is selling for exactly its par value is said to be trading at par

##### Coupon Rate

- it is the annual percentage of its par value that will be paid to bond holders

##### Frequency

- the frequency the payment is made, calculated from the annual coupon rate
- There are bonds which make annually, semi-annually, quarterly payments or even monthly payments
- The most common is semi-annual payments

##### Currency denomination

- Sometimes borrowers from countries with volatile currencies issue bonds denominated in U.S. dollars
  - U.S. dollar denominated bonds - Both the coupon payments and par value are in U.S. dollars
  - Dual-currency bond makes coupon interest payments in one currency and the principal repayments at maturity in another currency
  - Currency option bond gives bond holders a hoice of which two currencies they would like to receive their payments in

#### Law & Tax

- The legal regulatory and tax considerations that apply to the contract between the issuer and the bond holders

#### Contingency Provisions

- the contingency provisions that may affect the bonds scheduled cash flows
  - These contingency provisions are stated options in the contract
  - they give the issuer or the bondholders certain rights regarding the disposal or redemption of the bond

#### Yield of a Bond

- The price of a bond may fluctuate after it is issued at issuance
- the price of the bond would go back to its par value at maturity
- current yield - the bonds annual coupon divided by the current bonds price
- yield to maturity - an estimate of the annual return when investors hold it until maturity
  - it is the internal rate of return on bonds expected cash flows
  - yield to maturity is inversely related to the purchasing bonds price the higher the bonds price the lower its yield to maturity and vice versa

#### Coupon Structures

- a plain vanilla bond where coupon is paid regularly and the full par value returned on maturity

### Mutual Funds

- Mutual Funds collects money from individual investors and hires a manager to invest in various assets
  - It incur some management fee
  - When the mutual fund are used to track an index, it is called an index mutual funds. It has a lower management fee(MER or Expense Ratio)
- Mutual funds need to be purchased directly from a mutual fund company, a bank, or a broker

### Exchange Traded Funds(ETFs)

- ETFs is similar to index mutual funds and it can be exchanged like a stock with a management fee much lower than mutual funds
- When an ETF tracks a forenign market it can be either:
  - Hedged - The price of the fund is only reflected by the tracked security values
    - Extra work is required for the manager to cancel out the fluctation of the currency exchange rate, so it has a higher management fee
  - Unhedge - The price of the fund is reflected by both the tracked security values and currency exchange rate
    - It allows the investor to invest in currency exchange market at the same time, can increase diversity

### Alternative Investments

## Portfolio Management

- An investment portfolio contains a selection of investments with different weights, in order to control the risks
- Debt securities and equity securites market are negatively correlated(hedged), so investing in a combination of bonds and stocks is popular, and the portfolio can be described as the following allocation models when only considering invest in bonds and stocks:
  - An income portfolio consists primarily of dividend-paying stocks and coupon-yielding bonds where stocks takes from `0%` to `30%`
  - A balanced portfolio invests in both stocks and bonds to reduce potential volatility where stocks takes from `40%` to `60%`
  - A growth portfolio consists of mostly stocks where stocks takes from `70%` to `100%`
- A portfolio needs to be diversified to distribute risks using the following options:
  - select stocks that have different company cap size
  - select stocks that varies in types like growth stock and income stock, and location
  - select stocks from different stock exchange
  - select stocks from different sector

### Technical Analysis

- It is a combination of art and science, of forecasting the future price movement, that is based on an examination of the past price movements
- It works for all tradable instrucments which have prices fluctuated overtime
- Technical Analysis only focuses on the actual price movement, any consideration other than the price movement like financial reports and news are part of the fundamental analysis
- It is a type of quantitaive analysis, a part of fundamental analysis that doesn't rely on numbers are qualitative analysis
- The Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis
  - The market discounts everything - The final price of an aset on the market has taken everything into consideration including market psychology(Efficient Markets Hypothesis)
  - Price moves in trends - A price trend can always be identifid in a efficient and transparent market
  - History tends to repeat itself - the standing point of chart patterns analysis
- Types of charts
  - Line charts - it plots the closing price over time
    - A local maxima is called a peak, a local minima is called a trough
  - Bar charts - it plots a bar for the price action of each day, the highest daily price is at top of the bar and lowest daily price at the bottom of the bar, the bar is also colored in green and red to show the overall rise and fall
    - Daily bar charts - it indicates the opening price on the left on the bar and closing price on the right
  - Candlesticks charts - it plots bars which demostrate prices bounded by the opening and closing prices and use extended lines(called shadows) to show the highest and lowest prices for a selected time frame
    - time frame can be any time intervals based on the platform software
    - Doji candles are candles that describe the same open and closing prices
    - When it has no upper and lower shadow it is called Marubozu candles
  - Heikin Ashi charts - similar to Candlesticks but it uses the midpoint of the previous candle body as open value and use the average of open-high-low-close (OHLC) of the current period as close value
    - It is the refined version of Candlesticks charts that filters out noises
- There are different types of trading each with different focuses on the time frame:
  - Intraday Trading - Hold trades for few minutes to few hours but not overnight
    - Scalping - Hold trades for only few seconds or few minutes
  - Positional Trading - Holds trades overnight from a few days to few months
    - Intermediate - Hold trades for few weeks to few months but less than one year
    - Short Term(Swing Trading) - Hold trades for few days to few weeks
  - Long Term investment(Long-term Positional Trading) - Hold trades for more than one year
- Online analysis platform like [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com) is a popular choice for technical analysis

#### Trend Analysis

- The trend of the price shows the relationship of demand of supply, the trend only changes when an external force is applied
- Trend can be:
  - Uptrend - the overall price has higher highs, and higher lows
  - Downtrend - the overal price has lower lows, and lower highs
  - Sideways trend - a horizontal trend during the transition period between uptrends and downtrends
- The prices alway fluctuate within a trend, short term trading can take advantages of this property
- A trend that last for 5 to 20 years is called a secular trend
- Trends can be categorized by time frame
  - Major trend - long-term trend
  - Intermediate trend - 1 to 3 months trend within the major trend
  - Minor trend - trend within one month with the intermediate trend
- Stages are determined by the transation of trends
  - Stage 1 - The sideways trend after a downtrend
    - it is a consolidation phase that can be called a accumulation phase when price increases slowly
  - Stage 2 - The uptrend after stage 1
  - Excess Phase - sometimes exists in between stage 2 and stage 3, this price suddenly rises and it is a sign of stage 3
    - Exhaustion Phase always follows the excess phase, is a sudden price drop after the excess phase
    - Excess Phase and Exhaustion Phase together, are sometimes recognized as two main parts of a stage 3
  - Stage 3 - The sideways trend after an uptrend
    - It's a consolidation phase that can be a accumulation phase if price goes up or distribution phase if price goes down
  - Stage 4 - The downtrend after stage 3
- Trendline is one of the most important tools in technical analysis
  - Join all troughs will create the trend line for an uptrend(also known as support), and join the peaks for a downtrend(also known as resistance)
    - Support or resistance are dynamic for uptrend and downtrend, when it is horizontal(sideways trendlines) it is a static support or resistance
    - Sometimes resistance can changed to a support level when price goes up, or vice versa
    - the faster the prices change the more likely the prices will break the trendlines
    - Volumn spikes drive the price to break the trendlines
  - When the price is crossing the trendline, a trend is changing
    - it can change back to the same trend but with a different slope
  - Main Trand line with longer time frame can be intersected by an internal trendline with a shorter time frame
  - It is better to use logrithmic scale for the y-asix to draw the trend line
    - the space between larger numbers are smaller
  - The points used to draw trendlines should be evenly spaced
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a hanging man pattern which is a red bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
  - The local minima can be indicated by a hammer man pattern which is a green bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the dragonfly candle
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a shooting star pattern which is a red bar with long upper shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small lower shadow in the candlesticks chart, it ususlly follows a green bar
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the gravestone candle
  - Marubozu shows confidence in growth when green and decrease when red
- Fibonacci retracement

#### Indicators

- They can be categorized as:
  - lagging indicator - it is a financial sign that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place. Therefore, lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them
  - leading indicator - it corresponds with a future movement or change in some phenomenon of interest. It helps to predict and forecast future events and trends
  - oscillator - a line graph that moves between two extremes

##### Lagging Indicator

- Moving Average - indicates changes in trend
  - It calculates and, for each day, it plots the average of all previous prices in a given time frame over the price chart
  - Exponentional moving average(EMA) is preferred, it reacts quicker to small price changes
  - Simple moving average is suitable for big time frames
  - 200 days moving average is popular
    - Bull lives above(current prices are higher than average price) the a average chart, Bear lives below(current prices are lower than average price) the a average chart
    - It can also act as a support and resistent level
  - It only provides valuable information when martket is in trend
  - The intersections between moving average charts for various length of time frame can be used to indicate turning points
  - Different trading types use different period:
    - Long Term Investor - uses 200, 100, 50 periods
    - Positional Trader - uses 50, 21, 14 periods
    - Intraday Trader - uses 14, 7, 3 periods
- Moving Average Convergence/Divergence(MACD) - indicates changes in trend
  - It is also recognized as a momentum oscillator
  - It shows the postive or negative difference between a "fast" (short period) EMA, and a "slow" (longer period) EMA, in a bar chart
  - When the difference is positive the price goes up, otherwise, the price goes down

##### Oscillator

- The relative strength index (RSI) - It is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset
  - It can have a reading from 0 to 100, high RSI value(above 70) represents overbought,low RSI value(below 30) represents oversold
  - when above 50, it is an uptrend, when below 50, it is a downtrend
- The A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time
  - It is consisted of K line and D line ranging from 0 to 100
  - When K line cross above D line around 20, it is a buy signal
  - When K line cross below D line around 80, it is a sell signal
  - Whenever two lines falls below 20, it a signal of oversold. When two lines goes above 80, it is a signal of overbought
  - Sharpe bottom and broad top represents an uptrend and vice versa
  - Short-term market players tend to choose low settings for all variables, and vice versa

##### Fibanacci Retracement

- It is used to predict support level in a clear uptrend or downtrend
- The ratio of the adjecent number in a fibonacci series will approach to the golden ratio(`1.618`)
- The ratio used in the Fibanacci retracement tools are:
  - `0`
  - `0.236`, which is from `0.618-0.382`
  - `0.328`, which is from `1 - 0.618` or `0.618 * 0.618`
  - `0.5`, one half
  - `0.618`, which is the inverse of a golden ratio `1/1.618`, it is called the golden mean `0.618`
  - `0.786`, which is the square root of `0.618`
  - `0.88`
  - `1`
  - Extension Level 1 - `1.272`, which is the square root of `1.618`
  - Extension Level 2 - `2.618`, which is from `1.618 * 1.618`
  - Extension Level 3 - `4.236`, which is from `2.618 * 1.618`
- The ratio should be drawn between the peak and trough(a swing) from `1` to `0`
  - `1` should be at the trough for an uptrend
  - `1` should be at the peak for an downtrend
  - Usually, draw from left to right when using analysis platform softwares
- After drawing the scale, each ratio level can be treated as potential support level, since buyers tend to trade when those level are reached
- Draw the scale in a reverse order(from right to left) to use the extension levels, extension levels indicates the target prices(the next peak in an uptrend or the next trough in a downtrend)
- It is suggest to apply the scale on the current swing(the lastest known swing), and analysis on higher timeframe
  - When new swing forms draw the new scale on the new swing

## Risks

- All investment associates with some risks
- Generally higher risks yields more profit
- Risk Types:
  - Market Risk(systematic risk from the overall market)
  - Business Risk(Bankruptcy of a certain company)
  - Credit Risk(a company can't loan more money)

  - Liquidity Risk(A company has no cash flow)
  - Social, Political, and Regulatory Risk
  - Currency and Exchange Rate Risk(Import/Export companies)
  - Mutual Fund Manager Risk(Manager decision varies)
- Risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand in their financial planning
- An Investment Time Horizon, or Time Horizon, is the period of time one expects to hold an investment until they need the money back
- For people with high risk tolerance, the time horizon need to be longer
- Comparing risks among each types of securities, `Equity > Debt`
- Investing in stocks from small cap companies is more risker
