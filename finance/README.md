# Finance

- Finance, as a discipline, derived from ecomonics; it involves assessing money, banking, credit, investments, and other aspects of the financial systems

## Introduction

### Functions of the Financial System

1. Help its participants achieve their purposes in using the financial system
   - The participants in the financial system are primarily individuals, firms and governments
   - Purposes of the participants in using the financial system are:
     - Save
       - Individuals typically save for retirement and expect a return that compensates them for risk and the use of their money
       - Firm save a portion of their sales to fund future expendituresã€‚ Instruments used for saving include stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit or real assets such as real estate
     - Borrow
       - Individuals often borrow in order to buy a house, fund a college education or for other purposes
       - Governments may borrow by issuing debt to fund their expenditures
       - Firms may borrow in order to finance capital expenditures and for other activities
     - Issue equity
       - Firms can raise capital by issuing equity where the capital providers become shareholders of the company and will share in any future profits
       - The financial system facilitates raising equity capital through
         - investment banks which help with issuance
         - analysts value the equity
         - reporting requirements and accounting standards, ensure the production of meaningful financial disclosures
     - Manage risks
       - risks includes:
         - Changing interest rates
         - Currency values
         - Commodity values
         - Defaults on debt
     - Exchange assets
       - Trading contracts that serve as hedges for the risks
         - It is a method for managing risk
       - Difference from spot market trading, its more common and convenient to trade in an organized market governed by the financial system
         - spot market trading - trade directly with one another
       - Participants have operational needs to trade in market
     - Utilize information
       - Participants trade based on information that they believe allows them to predict future prices, in order to make profit
   - Overall the financial system allows
     - investors to save for the future at fair rates of return
     - creditworthy borrowers to obtain funds through debt or equity issuance
     - hedgers to easily trade away or offset risks
     - traders to easily exchange currencies, commodities and other assets they need
2. Determine the rates of return
   - the rates should equate the total supply of savings with the total demand for borrowing
   - Borrowing and lending can be viewed as demand and supply of money in the financial system.
   - The demand and supply are highly affected by the rate of return or interest rates
   - equilibrium interest rate - the rate at which the amount the borrowers desire is equal to the amount that the lenders desire
   - In many countries, the central bank plays an important role in guiding this equilibrium rate through monetary policy
3. allocate capital to its most efficient uses
   - As capital is limited, the financial system should be structured such that funds are allocated to uses that are most productive
   - In market based economies, lenders determine directly or indirectly which borrower obtains capital.Borrowers who have better credit ratings are perceived as being less risky. So lenders with a lower risk appetite will be fine with lending, even though the rate of return is lower.
     - This process is efficient only if market information is accurate.
     - The regulators and standard setting bodies have the responsibility to ensure that financial information is accurately reported in the most useful manner

#### Performance of Financial System

- The financial system is best at fulfilling these roles when
  - The markets are liquid
  - Transaction costs are low
  - Information is readily available
  - Regulation ensures the execution of contracts
- A well functioning financial system has prices that reflect fundamental values and should be
  - Operationally efficient - is where a market can perform these functions at low trading costs, including commissions, bid ask spreads and price impacts
  - Informationally efficient - is where the security prices reflect all the information associated with fundamental value in a timely fashion
    - Reporting requirements and accounting standards that produce meaningful and timely financial disclosures allow analysts to form more accurate estimates of fundamental values
  - Allocationally efficient, is where capital is allocated to its most productive use
- A well functioning financial system has financial intermediaries like
  - Exchanges, brokerages and alternative trading systems that match buyers to sellers
  - Dealers that provide liquidity on demand to traders
  - Securitisers is that securities assets to produce investment instruments that are attractive to investors, lowering interest costs for borrowers.
  - Banks that match investors to borrowers by taking deposits and making loans
  - Insurance companies that pool uncorrelated risks
  - Financial advisers that help investors manage and grow their assets
  - Clearinghouses that ensure everyone settles their trades and contracts and depositories that ensure nobody loses their assets
- In a well functioning financial system, savers and investors can directly or indirectly fund companies that need capital for expansion or projects, and transfer the risk to those that can better bear it.
  - These benefits are enhanced because the transactions can occur among strangers, widening the opportunities for capital formation and risk sharing in the economy

#### Market Regulations

- Market Regualtions are used to address the following issues
  - Fraud and Theft - Investors who often placed their trust in agents or investment managers to manage their wealth. It can be easy for the agents to steal or overcharge their clients if there are no safeguards in place. Furthermore, since returns are often random, it can be easy for agents to attribute client losses to market underperformance
    - Market Regualtions requires minimum standards of competency, and make it easier for investors to evaluate performance.
      - The CFA program and the global investment performance standards are part of this effort
  - Insider Trading - If market insiders are allowed to trade based on their privileged information, the playing field will be skewed towards them at a cost to investors who do not have such information. Without assurance of a level playing field, traders without inside information will exit the market and liquidity will be reduced
    - Regulators make it illegal and enforce the rules strictly such that traders are confident that the playing field is level
  - Costly Information - If market information comes at a high cost to investors, markets will not be as informationally efficient and investors will not invest as much
    - Regulations requires all companies to report according to a common financial reporting standard like IFRS or US GAP reporting on a common basis reduces costs of information gathering and comparisons across companies
  - Default - the risk of defaults where parties might not honor their obligations in the markets
    - Regulations require minimum levels of capital so that market participants will be able to honor their long term commitments
    - This is especially important for insurance companies and pension funds that individuals depend on for their financial future
- Regulations can be provided by governments and related entities, as well as industry groups, for example, most exchanges, clearing houses and dealer trade organizations are self-regulating organizations, meaning that they regulate their members
  - Governments sometimes delegate regulatory authority to such organizations.
- Without proper market regulation
  - Liquidity declines.
  - Firms shun risky projects
  - New ideas go unfunded
  - Economic growth slows.

### Types of Market

- Markets can be classifed in the following ways

#### Delivery Method

- Immediate delivery
  - Spot markets
- Future delivery
  - Forward markets
  - Futures markets
  - Options markets - delivery takes place only if the holders of the options choose to exercise them

#### Source

- Primary market - when issuers, which are mainly government or corporate entities, sell new securities to investors. The trade happens between the issuer and investor directly, with the help of the underwriter. One of the following transaction can happen in the primary market
  - An underwriter is any party that evaluates and assumes another party's risk for a fee, which often takes the form of a commission, premium, spread, or interest
  - If the securities are available to the public for first time, it is called initial public offering (IPO)
    - Otherwise, they are seasoned offerings or secondary issues
  - A primary offering can be a private placement to qualified investors
    - In a private placement firm sells securities directly to a small group of qualified investors, usually with the assistance of an investment bank, qualified investors or those with substantial wealth and investment knowledge
    - Private placements do not require the issuer to disclose as much information as they must when securities are being sold to the public
    - Therefore, the issuance costs may be lower than public offerings
    - Investors are likely to require higher returns, meaning a lower price as the securities are less liquid as they cannot be traded in an organized secondary market.
  - Shelf registrations - a firm registered securities for issuance as in a regular offering, but only issues the registered securities over time when it needs capital and when the markets are favorable
  - Dividend Reinvestment Plans - it allows existing shareholders to use their dividends to buy new shares from the firm at a slight discount
  - Rights offerings - Existing shareholders are given the right to buy new shares are discount to the current market price
    - Shareholders tend to dislike rights offerings because their ownership is diluted unless they exercise their rights and buy the additional shares
    - In some circumstances, shareholders can choose to trade the rights with other investors
  - Governments issue short term and long term debt, either by auction or through investment banks
- Secondary Markets is where daily tracsation happens after the securities go public, they are subsequent sales of securities, funds flow between traders
  - Secondary markets are important because they provide liquidity and price information
    - a liquid market is one in which a security can be sold quickly without incurring a significant discount from the current price
    - The liquidity of the secondary market is important to the primary market. Buyers value liquidity and will pay more for securities that they can easily sell. This enables issuers to raise capital in the primary markets at a lower cost
  - Secondary Markets can be categorized into Call Market and Continuous Trading Market based on when securities are traded or Quote-Driven Market, Order-Driven Market and Brokered Market based on how they are traded
  - Call Market is a type of secondary market where stocks can be traded only at specific times
    - All interested buyers and sellers of a stock gather at a specific time and place to declare their bids and asks
    - A call market can be very liquid when in session because all traders are present, but illiquid between sessions
    - Call markets usually are organized just once a day, but some markets organize calls at more frequent intervals
  - Continuous Trading Market is where trades can be arranged and executed at any time the market is open
    - Many continuous trading markets start their trading with a call market auction during a preopening period. Traders submit their orders for the market call at the opening, Some also close their trading session with a call
  - Quote-Driven Market is where investors trade with dealers
    - commonly known as over-the-counter markets
    - Most securities other than stocks trade in Quote-Driven Market
  - Order-Driven Market is where rules are used to match buyers and sellers
    - Stocks are mostly traded in exchanges or automated trading systems in a Order-Driven Market
    - Orders are placed in a queue and executed based on the clients instruction, order matching rules are used to determine which order gets priority over others and how the orders are matched
      - price priority is the number one criterion where the most aggressively priced orders get priority
        - This means that the highest priced bid orders and the lowest priced ask orders go first
      - If orders are at the same prices, a secondary precedence rule gives priority to non hidden orders
      - If that's also the same than the earliest arriving orders get the priority
    - Order matching rules encourage traders to price their trades aggressively, display their entire orders and trade earlier, thereby improving liquidity
    - In continuous trading markets, the discriminatory pricing rule is often practiced, the limit price of the order that arrived first determines the trade price, donesn't matter if its a buy or sell order
    - In call markets. Uniform pricing rule allows all orders trade at the same price, which is the price that results in the highest volume of trading
    - In crossing networks, derivative pricing rule is practiced where the price is often the midpoint between the best bid and ask quotes published by the other exchange
      - Crossing networks are trading systems that match traders who are willing to trade at prices obtained from other exchanges
  - Brokered Markets where investors use brokers to locate a counterparty to a trade
    - This service is usually for assets that are unique or illiquid, like very large blocks of stock, real estate and artwork
  - Markets also differ in the type and quantity of data that they disseminate to the public
    - Pre-Trade Transparent Markets - publish real time data about quotes and orders
      - Buy-side traders prefer this type of market because the transparency allows better understanding of security values and trading costs
    - Post-Trade Transparent - publish trade prices and sizes only after the trades occur
      - Dealers prefer this type, which are more opaque as it gives them an informational advantage over traders who trade less frequently
      - Transaction costs and bid ask spreads are larger in opaque markets

#### Maturity

- Money markets refer to markets for debt securities with maturities of one year or less, such as
  - repurchase agreements
  - negotiable certificates of deposit
  - government bills
  - commercial paper
- Capital markets refer to markets for longer term debt, securities and equity securities that have no specific maturity date

#### Convention

- Traditional investments include all publicly traded debts and equities and shares in pooled investment vehicles that hold publicly traded debts and or equities like an equity index ETF
- Alternative investments include hedge funds, private equities, commodities, real estate and infrastructure investments, because these investments are often hard to trade and hard to value, they often sell at a discount and require substantial investor due diligence

### Financial Intermediaries

- Financial intermediaries stand between buyers and sellers, facilitating the exchange of assets, capital and risk
- Financial intermediaries can be ons of the followings

#### Brokers

- Brokers help their clients buy and sell securities with each other by finding counterparty to trade in a cost efficient manner
- Brokers may work for large brokerage firms, for banks or at exchanges.
- Block brokers help with a placement of large trades by concealing clients intentions, so that the market does not move against them
- Investment banks are also considered a form of brokers as they help corporations sell common stock, preferred stock and bonds to investors
  - They also provide advice to firms notably about mergers, acquisitions and raising capital

#### Exchanges

- Exchanges provide a venue where different parties can trade with each other
- They can act as brokers by providing electronic order
- Exchanges also regulate their members and require firms that list on the exchange to provide faithful and timely financial disclosures to allow analysts to value the securities issued by them
- Exchanges acquire their regulatory power through the member agreement or from their governments
- Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) serves the same trading function as exchanges but have no regulatory function
  - They're also known as Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) or Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs)
  - Large investment managers, prefer to use these systems when they want to keep large transactions secret

#### Dealers

- Unlike brokers and exchanges, dealer buy and sell securities directly from the traders, and they do maintain an inventory
- Dealers provide liquidity in the market and profit primarily from the spread between the bid (purchasing) price and the ask (selling) price
  - This difference between the bid and ask prices is referred to as the bid ask spread
  - The bid and ask are quoted for specific trade sizes, larger size trades often have narrower bid ask spreads
  - More liquid securities have lower bid ask spreads
  - In one market, there can be several dealers, the quotation in the market is the highest paid and lowest ask from among all dealers in a particular security
  - Traders who post bids and offers are said to make a market, while those who trade with them at posted prices are set to take the market
- A dealer can also act as a broker and help client to buy or sell with a counterparty or directly with itself, then it can be called a broker dealer
  - There is an inherent conflict of interest
    - As a broker, it should seek the best prices for the client.
    - As a dealer, its goal is to profit through prices or spreads.
    - As a result, traders typically place limits on how their orders are filled when they transact with broker dealers
- They connect buyers and sellers that arrive at different times in the same market

#### Securitisers

- Securitisers pool large amounts of securities or assets and then send interests in the pool to investors
- This large amounts of securities are commonly known as asset backed securities
- An asset-backed security (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assetsâ€”usually ones that generate a cashflow. The investors can get this cashflow after certain securitisers fees are deducted
  - Assets that are often securitized include mortgages, car loans, credit card receivables, bank loans and equipment leases
  - Some asset backed securities are securitized by firms which set up a separate legal entity known as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to buy some of its assets
    - This removes the assets from the firm's balance sheet and may increase their value to investors as the assets are now bankruptcy remote from the originating firm
      - This means that creditors of the firm cannot lay claim to the assets sold to the SPV
- These securities are commonly segregated into multiple categories called tranches
  - the senior tranches provide the most certain cash flows, while the junior and subordinated tranches have greater risk
- The benifit of securitization
  - Having different tranches allows investors to invest according to their required risk and returns
  - The large pool of securites is split into many units or shares, as a result the minimum investment amount is lower
  - Diversification benefits in pooling assets together
  - Cash flows get more predictable
  - Liquidity is improved as the securities are more easily traded
  - There are also economies of scale in the management costs of large pools of assets
  - Potential benefits from the managers expertise in selecting assets

#### Depository Institutions

- Types of depository institutions
  - Banks - they take on customer deposits, pay interest on them and provide transaction services such as checking accounts, then they make loans to various borrowers and earn interest
    - Most banks have expertise in evaluating credit quality and managing the risk of a portfolio of loans of various types
  - Payday lenders and Factoring companies - they lend money to firms and individuals on the basis of their wages, accounts receivable and other future cash flows
    - They often finance the loans by issuing commercial paper or other debt securities
  - Prime brokers - a special type of broker that act as depository institutions
    - Securities brokers provide loans to investors who purchase securities on margin
    - When this margin lending is to hedge funds and other institutions, they are prime brokers
- The deposits from the depositors and the debt from the lenders can be considered the liabilities of the institution in its balance sheet
- There are also stockholders who supply capital to institutions, and this forms the equity capital
  - Bank capital represents the value invested in the bank by its owners and/or investors. It is calculated as the sum of the bank's assets minus the sum of the bank's liabilities, or being equal to the bank's equity
  - The stockholders absorb any loan losses before the lenders and depositors
  - The more equity capital the institution has, the less risk for depositors

#### Insurance Companies

- They collect insurance premiums in return for providing risk reduction to the insured
- The insurance firm can do this efficiently when it provides protection to a diversified pool of policyholders whose risks of loss are typically uncorrelated
  - This provides more predictable cash flows compared to a single insurance contract
- they connect the buyers of their insurance contracts with investors, creditors and reinsurers who are willing to bear the insured risks
- Insurance companies provide a benefit to investors by managing the risks inherent in insurance
- Insurance companies manages the following risks
  - `Moral Hazard` occurs because the insured may take more risks once he is protected against losses
  - `Adverse Selection` occurs when those most likely to experience losses are the predominant buyers of insurance
  - `fraudulent claims` occurs when the insurers purposely causes damage or fakes losses so they can make an insurance claim

#### Arbitragers

- Arbitrageurs trade when they can identify opportunities to buy and sell identical or essentially similar instruments at different prices in different markets
  - They profit when they can buy in one market for less than they sell in another market
- They connect sellers in one market to buyers in another market in the same time
- The purest form of arbitrage involves buying and selling the same instrument in two different markets, in markets with good information, pure arbitrage is rare because traders will favor the markets with the best prices
- More commonly, arbitrageurs trade securities or contracts whose values depend on the same underlying factors

#### Clearinghouses

- They are responsible for the final settlement of trades
  - They transfer money from the buyer to the seller while transferring securities from the seller to the buyer in future markets
  - They guarantee contract completion, making sure that both the long and the short fulfill their contractual agreement for margin trades
  - They ensures that they pose sufficient margin and limit the aggregate net order quantity of the members
- As a result, The clearinghouse limit counterparty risk, which is the risk that the other party to a transaction will not fulfill its obligation
- In some markets, the clearinghouse ensures only the trades of its member brokers and dealers, who in turn ensure the trades of their retail customers
- Custodian's also improve market integrity by holding clients securities, these services, which are often offered by banks, help prevent the loss of securities through fraud, oversight or natural disaster

### Financial Positions

- In order to achieve financial goals or manage financial risks, an investor has to take a position in an asset

#### Long Positions

- The investor takes a long position when he owns an asset
- Long positions benefit from an appreciation in the prices of the assets owned
  - The investor profits by purchasing at a low price and selling at a high price

#### Short Positions

- The investor takes a short position when he has sold assets that he does not own
- Short positions benefit from a decrease in the prices of the assets sold
  - Short sellers profit by selling at high prices and repurchasing at lower prices
- Short sellers need to borrow the stocks from securities lender and sold it at a high price, then deposit the cash gained from the transcaction to the lender, it is the short seller responsibility to purchase and return (short covering) the borrowed stocks regardless the market price
  - A short seller may also be required to deposit additional margin in the form of cash or short term riskless securities
  - The lender then earns interest on these funds and may return a portion of this interest to the short seller
  - This is at a rate referred to as the short rebate rate, typically `0.1%` less than overnight interest rates
  - If the security is difficult to borrow, the short rebate rate may be lower or negative
  - The short seller must pay to the lender all dividends or interest that the lender would have received from the security
    - These payments are called payments in lieu of dividends or interest

#### Leveraged Positions

- Traders can borrow money from the broker to purchase securities
  - The loan can be called the margin loan, this loan is backed by the equity position of the investor in their investment account
    - This minimun equity position amount must meet the initial margin requirement, which can be set by the government exchange clearinghouse or broker
    - The leverage ratio of a margin investment is the value of the total asset divided by the value of the equity position
  - Such purchases can be called the margin purchase
- Investor need to pay interest on the margin loan, this interest is known as the call money rate
  - This rate is generally higher than the government bill rate
  - For larger investors with better collateral, the call money rate is lower
- The use of leverage magnifies both the gains and losses
  - This additional risk is referred to as risk from financial leverage
- Brokers usually enforce a maintenance margin requirement on the trader
  - This is the minimum equity percentage that the trader must maintain in the account
  - This is typically `25%` of the current position value
    - But brokers may require a greater minimum equity percentage for volatile stocks
- If the percentage of equity in a margin account falls below the maintenance margin requirement, the investor will receive a margin call, a request to bring the equity percentage in the account back up to the maintenance margin percentage
  - An investor can satisfy this request by depositing additional funds or depositing other on margin securities
  - If the investor does not meet the margin call, the broker must sell the position
  - The margin call will be trigger when the asset value fall below `initial purchase price * (1 - initial margin percentage) / (1 - maintenance margin percentage)`

### Market Instructions

- When investors want to trade, they must enter orders that specify whether to buy or sell and the size of the trade, plus the following three instrcutions

#### Execution Instructions

- They specify how to trade, the most common are
  - A market order instructs the broker to execute the trade immediately at the best possible price available in the current market ask or bid queue
    - A market order is often appropriate when the trader wants to execute quickly, as when the trader has information she believes is not yet reflected in market prices.
    - Uncertainty is the biggest shortcoming of market orders, especially if the security has low trading volume relative to the order size
  - A limit order places a minimum execution price on sell orders and a maximum execution price on buy orders, and only buy or sell when the current market has stock available with price within the limit
    - The disadvantage is that the order might not be filled or only be partially filled
- Limit order terminology
  - A limit buy order above the best ask or a limit sell order below the best bid are said to be marketable or aggressively priced, because at least part of the order is likely to execute immediately
  - If the limit price is between the best bid and the best, ask a limit order is said to be making a new market or inside the market
  - limit orders waiting to execute a called standing limit orders
  - A limit by order at the best bid or a limit sell order at the best ask are said to make the market
  - A buy order with a limit price below the best bid or a sell order with a limit price above the best ask is said to be behind the market
  - A limit by order with a price considerably lower than the best bid or a limit sell order with a price significantly higher than the best ask is said to be far from the market
- Traders can also specify the volume of the trade
  - If there's no specification, the broker makes a best effort attempt to fill as many units before the order expires
  - If the trade specifies an all or nothing order, the broker executes only if the whole order can be filled
  - Traders can also specify the minimum size of a trade. The trade only executes if the minimum size can be met
    - This type of order is beneficial when trading costs depend on the number of executed trades rather than the size of the order
- Trade visibility can also be specified
  - Investors that have a large amount to trade and do not want to reveal their intentions prefer hidden orders for which only the broker or exchange know the trade size
  - Traders can also specify displaces where some of the trade is visible to the market, but the rest is not
    - These are also referred to as iceberg orders because part or most of the order is hidden from view.
    - They allow the investor to advertise some of the trade without revealing the actual size of the trade.

#### Validity Instructions

- They specify when the order can be executed
  - Day orders, meaning they expire if unfulfilled by the end of the trading day
  - Good to cancel orders last until they are filled or when the trader cancels the order
  - Immediate or cancel orders are canceled unless they can be filled immediately
    - They're also known as fill or kill orders
  - Good-on-close orders, are filled at the end of the trading day
    - If they are market orders, they're referred to as market-on-closed orders
      - These are often used by mutual funds because their portfolios are valued using closing prices
  - Good-on-open orders, are filled at the open of the next trading day
  - Stop orders are those that execute only when the stock price has been met
    - They're often referred to as stop loss orders because they can be used to prevent losses or to protect profits
    - It is a market order triggerred by pre-set price limit
    - It can be a stop-sell order or stop-buy order for short seller to prevent loss
    - Inverstors can also use stop-buy order to confirm the stock will rise

#### Clearing Instructions

- They specify how to settle the trade
  - Retail trades are typically cleared and settled by the same broker who arranged the trade
  - Institutional trades may be settled by a custodian or another broker, which might be the traders prime broker using to brokers, allows the investor to keep one broker as the prime broker for margin and custodial services while it engages other brokers for specialized arrangements
- When a trader issues a sell order, one important clearing instruction is to specify whether it is a long sale or short sale
  - For a long sale, the broker must confirm that the securities held are available for delivery
  - For a short sale, the broker must either borrow the security on behalf of the client or confirm that the client can borrow the security

### Market Efficiency

## Securities

- A security is a financial investment with some monetary value
- It has the following categories:
  - Debt Securities - The majority of debt securities are loans called bonds
  - Equity Securities - The ownership shares of a corporation
    - It can have shares in pooled investment vehicles
  - Derivative Securities - Purchasing derivative securities will grant the investor the right to trade other financial securities at pre-agreed upon terms
    - Futures contracts - A type of derivative securities that one has agreed to purchase assets(mostly commodities) for an agreed-upon price in the future
    - Stock options - A type of derivative securities that grants the right to purchase shares for a discounted price in the future
- Securities market index - It is used to represent the performance of an asset class, security market or segment of a market
  - they're usually created by selecting a number of representatives securities in the marke. These elected securities are known as the constituent securities of the index
  - Price Index - The numerical value calculated from the market prices of the constituent securities at that particular instance
  - Price Return - The percentage change in the price index over a period of time
  - Return Index - It takes into account the interim cash flows, such as dividends or interest payments issued by the securities
  - Total Return - The percentage change in the return index over a period of time
  - Aggregate Return - The percentage return calculated for a longer period, which is the product of the return factors of each smaller period, then minus 1.
    - the return factors are the return percentage plus 1, negative returns have return factors smaller than 1
  - In order to construct a meaningful index, the index provider need to
    1. Determine the target market the index is intended to measure
       - It may be defined by asset class, geographic region or other characteristics like economic sector, company size, duration or credit quality
    2. Select securities from the target market
       - Some equity indexes fixed the number of stocks to be selected
       - It can be determined by an objective rule such as the number of shares outstanding, the number of shareholders and market capitalization or subjectively by a committee
    3. to determine the weighting scheme, that is how each security should be weighted in the index
       - a price weighted index is simply an arithmetic average of the prices of the securities included in the index
         - In the event of a stock split, the index provider will adjust the denominator accordingly. However the weight of that stock will be reduced. Actions like stock splits, stock dividends and stock repurchase affect the prices of the affected stocks and shifts the weight distribution of the entire index as a result
         - Another disadvantage is that higher priced stocks have more weight, but the price of a stock has no indication of how large a company actually is
       - A market cap weighted index has weights based on the market cap of each stock as a proportion of the total market cap of all the stocks in the index, It tracks the growth factor of the sum of the market cap of all selected stock for the index, then multiply it by 100
         - It does not need to be adjusted when a stock splits or pays a stock dividend, because the market cap of a stock is not affected by stock splits or stock dividends
         - This weighting method more closely represents changes in aggregate investor wealth in the entire market
         - It's disadvantage is similar to following a momentum strategy under which the most successful stocks are given the greatest weights and poor performing stocks are underweighted
       - A float adjusted market cap weighted index - similar to market cap weighted but only use firm market float for the market cap calculation
         - firms market float is the number of the (floating) shares that are actually available to the investing public and excludes the shares held by controlling stock holders because they are unlikely to sell their shares, shares held by large corporations or governments are often excluded as well
       - A free float adjusted market cap weighted index is similar to float adjusted weighted, but it also exclude stock that is not available for foreign investors
       - An equal weighted index is calculated as the arithmetic average return of the index stocks
         - note that it is the return of each stock and not the price as used in a price weighted index
       - An fundamental weighted index uses weights based on firm fundamentals such as earnings, dividends or cash flow. The weights can be based on a single measure or some combination of these measures
         - It avoids the bias that market cap indexes have toward the performance of the shares of overvalued firms
         - It can overweight a stock because the metrics used in the calculation like earning or dividends of the stock is too high
    4. to rebalancing the weight - It is the process of adjusting the weights of securities in a portfolio to their target weights after price changes have affected the weights
       - The weights in price and market cap weighted indexes will adjust by itself
       - Equal weighted and fundamental weighted index need to be rebalanced periodically
       - Rebalancing will lead higher transaction cost
    5. to reconstitute index - It is the process of adding and deleting constituent securities that make up the index
       - This is necessary as some firms may go bankrupt, be delisted, or if they no longer meet the criteria of the index
       - Deleted securities are replaced by other securities that meet the index criteria. The deletion and insertion of securities to an index can also be at the subjective judgment of a committee
       - When a security is added to an index, its price tends to rise as portfolio managers tracking index buys the security, the prices of deleted securities tend to fall as portfolio managers sell them
       - Reconstitution also requires that the weights on the returns of other index stocks be adjusted to conform to the desired weighting scheme
  - The uses of market indexes
    1. provide a gauge of investor confidence or market sentiment by looking at the trend of the indexes
       - A broader market index are more appropriate for this purpose
    2. can be a measure of the risk and return of an asset class by studying the historical returns of a index to estimate the expected return and standard deviation of returns for a market
       - useful when optimizing portfolio allocation
    3. can be used as a measure of beta and to determine the systematic risk adjusted return by comparing the expected returns with the actual stock returns
    4. can be used to benchmark a manager's performance
       - the chosen benchmark index should be consistent with the manager's investment approach and style on the market the manager operates in
    5. can serve as model portfolios for index funds or ETFs
       - Index funds and ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to a particular index
       - There are index mutual funds and some private portfolios that are structured to match the return of an index as well

### Fixed Income Securities

- A fixed income security is an instrument that allows a borrower to borrow money from a lender
- The most common type of fixed income security is a bond, sometimes two terms are used interchangeably
- a bond is a contractual agreement between the bond issuer and the bond holders

    - Short term debt issued by firms is known as commercial paper,
    - Short term government debt is sometimes called bills.
    - Repurchase agreements or repos. - The borrower sells a high quality asset to the lender and has both the right and obligation to repurchase it at a higher price in the future
      - Repos can be as short as one day
  - Intermediate term - in between short term and long term
  - Long term - usually more than 10 years
- Bonds are generally long term and notes are generally intermediate term
- Convertible debt - debt instruments that have the option to be exchanged for a specified number of equity shares of the issuing firm
- Fixed income securities typically have a fixed maturity date where the principal is repaid and interest is paid out periodically before maturity

#### Bonds Features

##### Issuer

- The government sector issues government bonds
  - supranational entities - government related organizations that operate globally(e.g. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund(IMF))
  - sovereign nation governments - A country that issues bonds to fund some of their budget(e.g. U.S. Treasury bonds)
  - non sovereign governments - government entities that are not national governments(e.g. City of Toronto, the state of California)

- The corporate sector issues corporate bonds
  - some issued by financial companies such as banks and insurance companies
  - some issued by non-financial companies
- The structured finance sector issues asset backed securities from special legal entities that securitize assets

##### Maturity

- Maturity date is the date on which the principal is to be repaid once a bond has been issued
- the term to maturity (tenor) - The time remaining until maturity date
- terms to maturity can be as short as one day or as long as thirty years or more
  - money market securities bonds has original maturities of one year or less
  - capital market securities has original maturities of more than one year
  - perpetual bonds don't have a maturity date
- The time remaining until maturity is referred to as the term to maturity or tenor of a bond, it make periodic interest payments but do not promise to repay the principal amount

##### Par value

- the principal amount that will be repaid at maturity
- It is also referred to as the face value, maturity value, redemption value or principal value of a bond
- bonds prices are commonly quoted as a percentage of par(e.g. bonds qouted as 105 has price which is 105% of the par value)
- a bond that is selling for more than its par value is said to be trading at a premium to par
- a bond that is selling at less than its par value is said to be trading at a discount to par
- a bond that is selling for exactly its par value is said to be trading at par

##### Coupon Rate

- it is the annual percentage of its par value that will be paid to bond holders

##### Frequency

- the frequency the payment is made, calculated from the annual coupon rate
- There are bonds which make annually, semi-annually, quarterly payments or even monthly payments
- The most common is semi-annual payments

##### Currency Denomination

- Sometimes borrowers from countries with volatile currencies issue bonds denominated in U.S. dollars
  - U.S. dollar denominated bonds - Both the coupon payments and par value are in U.S. dollars
  - Dual-currency bond makes coupon interest payments in one currency and the principal repayments at maturity in another currency
  - Currency option bond gives bond holders a hoice of which two currencies they would like to receive their payments in

#### Law & Tax

- The legal regulatory and tax considerations that apply to the contract between the issuer and the bond holders

#### Contingency Provisions

- the contingency provisions that may affect the bonds scheduled cash flows
  - These contingency provisions are stated options in the contract
  - they give the issuer or the bondholders certain rights regarding the disposal or redemption of the bond

#### Yield of a Bond

- The price of a bond may fluctuate after it is issued at issuance
- the price of the bond would go back to its par value at maturity
- current yield - the bonds annual coupon divided by the current bonds price
- yield to maturity - an estimate of the annual return when investors hold it until maturity
  - it is the internal rate of return on bonds expected cash flows
  - yield to maturity is inversely related to the purchasing bonds price the higher the bonds price the lower its yield to maturity and vice versa

#### Coupon Structures

- a plain vanilla bond where coupon is paid regularly and the full par value returned on maturity
- zero coupon
- fixed coupon
- floating rate notes

#### Types of Fixed Income Indexes

- Aggregate or broad market indices - it represent the broad market of fixed income securities of a geographic region
  - The Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is a single country aggregate index, it comprises more than 9200 U.S. based securities, including US Treasury, government related corporate bonds under various business sectors and various types of asset backed securities
- Indexes can be created the track securites from a certain market sector
  - market sector can be categorized into
    - government
    - government agency
    - corporate - it can be further categoized by the business sector that it operates in, the energy, finance, health care or the technology sector
    - structured finance - it creates structured securities like asset backed securities and collateral debt obligations
- Indexes can group securities based on the style with determined by
  - Credit quality of the security - it can be broadly classified as
    - investment grade - those with a standard investment rating of BBB or better
    - non-investment grade - also known as high yield securities
  - The time to maturity
- Some indices may also choose to distinguish themselves based on other characteristics, like
  - Coupon structure and coupon rates
  - Embedded options such as convertibility to common stock, callable, and putable options
- Some indices use a combination of the above characteristics
  - The Markit iBoxx Euro Liquid High-Yield Bond Index that tracks only euro denominated corporate bonds which are non-investment grade. It does not track bonds that have maturity greater than 10 years or zero coupon bonds, convertible and putable bonds are also excluded
- Issues with the construction of fixed income indices
  - securities are issued not just by firms, but also by governments and government agencies. Each of these entities may also issue various types of fixed income securities, selecting securities that can meaningfully represent such a wide market may not be easy
  - Bonds mature and must be replaced in fixed income indices, turnover is high in fixed income indices
  - Illiquidity, a lack of recent trades may require index providers to estimate the value of some securities from recent prices of securities with similar characteristics
- Challenges for portfolio managers
  - Illiquidity results in a high transaction costs
  - High turnover make it hard and even more expensive to replicate

### Equity

- Equity securities represent ownership in a firm
- Types:
  - Preferred stock - an equity security that pays regular dividends that is typically fixed over the securities life
    - Different from bonds as there is no maturity date and the dividends can only be paid after interest payments to debt holders have been fulfilled
  - Common stock
    - A residual claim on a firm's assets, common stock dividends are paid only after dividends are paid to preferred stock holders. Therefore, dividend payouts are not fixed and are entirely at the discretion of the management
  - Warrants
    - Warrants are similar to options in that they give the holder the right to buy a firm's common stock at the stated exercise price prior to the warrants, expiration warrants are considered equity because they are issued by the company and can potentially become equity if the holder exercises the right to purchase
- In the event of firm liquidation, debt holders have priority over preferred stockholders who in turn have priority over common stockholders
- Stock of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided
  - Similar to shares
- Stocks can be of different types with various rights(voting)
- When companies decided to sell its share to the public (IPO) on stock exchange
  - A company will hire an underwriter(mostly investment bank) who will help the company to sell the IPO portion of its shares publically
    - the issuer provides information about its finance and prospects, as well as how the funds will be used. The investment bank disseminates this information to interested investors and gets preliminary agreements to buy part of the issue.
    - These are not actual orders, but are referred to as indications of interest, the investment bank adjust the number of shares to be offered based on buyers' interest
    - The process of gathering indications of interest is referred to as book building
    - In London, the book builder is referred to as the book runner
    - In Europe, an accelerated book build occurs when securities must be issued quickly
  - Firm Commitment - the underwriter buys all the shares available for sell first, under a guaranteed price
  - In an underwritten offering, the investment bank takes the role of an underwriter who agrees to purchase the entire issue at a price that is negotiated between the issuer and the bank
    - For large issues, a syndicate of investment banks and broker dealers helps the lead underwriter build the book
    - If the issue is priced too high, it may be undersubscribed, the investment bank must buy the unsold portion
    - In the case of an IPO, the investment bank also agrees to make a market in the stock for a period after the issuance to provide price support for the issuer
    - If it's priced too low, the issue may be oversubscribed. Not every investor gets the amount they applied for, which may mean that the issuer is not getting a fair deal
    - In an underwritten offering, investment banks have a conflict of interest. As the issuer's agents, they should set the price high to raise the most funds for the issuer. But as underwriters, they would prefer that the price be set low enough that the whole issue sells.
      - This also allows them to allocate portions of an undervalued IPO to their clients.
      - This results in IPOs typically being underpriced.
    - Some insurers may also prefer underpricing the IPO because oversubscription and the subsequent trading above IPO price is good publicity for the firm. Such an IPO is referred to as a hot issue.
  - Best efforts offering - the investment bank does not commit to purchase the whole issue. It acts only as a broker to issue the shares to interested investors
    - If the issue is undersubscribed, the issuer may not raise the desired amount
  - Regulatory compliance of financial disclosures and transparency is established during IPO
  - IPO shares can only be purchased through the underwriter with some requirement
- A company's value, market cap, or market value in the stock exchange is determined by multiplying the outstanding stocks(number of shares available in the market) by the stock price, the cap ranges are as follows:
  - Large Cap: Greater than `$10` billion
  - Mid Cap: `$2-$10` billion
  - Small Cap: Less than `$2` billion
- The potential value of the company can be determined from its earning, public companies are required to report their earnings four times a year
- A stockbroker or broker buys and sells stocks at the direction of clients. Most buy and sell orders are now made through online discount brokers
- Broker provides two main types of account
  - Cash account - requires that all transactions must be made with available cash or long positions
  - Margin accounts - allow investors to borrow money against the value of the securities in their account
- Supply and demand in the market determine stock price, every time the stock is traded, the price changes
- The profit of trading stocks is from buy at low and sell to high
- Short selling is a way to make profit when stock price drops, the investor borrows shares from a brokers' client and sell it to a new client at a high price, when price drops the investor purchase new shares from the market at a low price then return the shares to its original holder
  - short selling is more risky since there is no limit for price to rise, so the potential loss has no limit
- After-hours trading happens during extended hours when the major exchanges are closed, through computerized trading systems, or electronic markets
  - Not all brokers offer after-hours trading
- companies could buy back shares of their own stock, so the stock prices can increase
- A stock split is when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple new shares to boost the stock's liquidity, and lower the price of the stock
  - The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier
  - Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, combine multiple stocks into one
  - For each shareholder the total shares value on hand keep the same
- Historically, overall stock prices always recover and go up over time with an average annual return around `10%`
- A stock can be categorized by the following types:
  - Income stock - it returns a percentage of the stock prices to the holder quaterly(or monthly determined by the company)
  - Growth stock - A stock with no dividend, the company will use all its profit and the try to grow faster
  - Value stock - undervalued stocks with some dividend

    - an equal weighted index
- Types of equity indexes
  - A broad equity market index represents an entire given equity market and typically includes stocks representing more than 90 percent of the selected market
  - Multi-Market indices usually comprise indices from different countries and are designed to represent multiple stock markets, such indices may represent multiple national markets based on geographic regions (Asian Pacific Index), economic development groups (Emerging Markets), or even the entire world (World Index)
    - World indices are important to investors who take a global approach to equity investments
    - Multi-market index with fundamental waiting - It weights the stocks within each country by market capitalization and then weight each country in the overall index based on some fundamental metric (like GDP of a country)
  - Sector indices represent ontrack different economic sectors such as consumer goods, energy finance, health care and technology on either a national, regional or global basis
    - Different sectors of the economy behave differently over the course of the economic cycle. Some investors may seek to overweight or underweight their exposure to the different sectors based on the stage of economic cycle
  - Style indices can be categorized according to market cap, value or growth or a combination of these characteristics
    - they're intended to reflect the investing styles of certain investors, such as the small cap, investor growth investor and value investor
    - Market cap indices can be differentiated along the lines of small cap, mid-cap and large cap stocks. Classification can be based on absolute market capitalization (the cap value) or relative market capitalization (the cap value rank)
    - Value stocks and growth stocks can be differentiated based on their price to earnings ratios or dividend yields
    - Some indices reflect a combination of the market cap and growth or value styles, they are small-cap value, mid-cap value, large-cap value, small-cap growth, mid-cap growth and large-cap growth
    - there's no universal definition regarding the classifications
    - Valuation ratios and market cap are the companies change over time, stocks frequently migrate from one style index category to another on reconstitution dates
- Volume is the amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time(often daily)
  - The average volume is the average of the (daily) volumes for a specified period. e.g. `Avg. Volumn(10)` is the 10 days average, `Average Volumn(3m)` is the 3 months average
- Valuation Ratios
  - Price to Earnings(P/E) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS)
    - A lower `P/E` ratio means the stock price is undervalued
  - The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the annual EPS growth rate
    - Any PEG ratio that is smaller than 1.0 is good
  - The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a ratio that compares a company market cap to its revenue over the past 12 months
  - The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value, the book value is the total book value of all the shareholders determined when they buy the shares
  - Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price
    - this ratio can go up when the stock price drops, since the the pay out amound keeps the same
  - The dividend payout ratio is the ratio of the total amount of dividends paid out to shareholders relative to the net income of the company
- Profitability Ratios
  - Return on Assets(ROA) an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its total assets

  - Asset turnover ratio measures the value of a company's sales or revenues relative to the value of its assets
- Liquidity Ratios
  - The current ratio is the proportion of the amount of current assets which only can be sold in one year divided by the amount of current liabilities
    - The higher the better, should be at least great than 1.0
  - The quick ratio is the proportion of the amount of current assets which only can be sold quickly exclude all the inventory divided by the amount of current liabilities
    - This calculation is more conservative than the current ratio
- Debt Ratios
  - The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a companyâ€™s total liabilities by its shareholder equity
  - Interest coverage ratio can be calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense

### Contracts

- Contracts are generally agreements between two parties to perform some action in the future
- for financial contracts. These actions are often based on security prices, currency exchange rates, commodity prices or security indexes
- Commonly known as derivatives
- Contracts can have both long sides and short sides
- Derivatives can be a contract which is a agreements between two parties to perform some action in the future for financial contracts.
- These actions are often based on security prices, currency exchange rates, commodity prices or security indexes
- Derivatives are a type of securities that derive values from underlyings like assets or securites
  - In reality, the underlying of a derivative can be any know assets like interest rate, foreign currency exchange rates, market indices or other derivatives, or even weather condition
- Derivatives can be `Exchange-Traded` - traded over a central exchange backed by a clearing house
  - Trade with the clearinghouse
  - clearinghouse enforces rules like margins
  - It uses standardized contracts with standard rules and requirement, it is regulated, and generally safer
  - Trades are easy to reverse(quit) or reduce(quit parially), since they can be transferred to others in the market easily
- Derivatives can be traded `Over-the-Counter (OTC)` - traded by dealers without a central location
  - Trade directly with the counterparty
  - It uses custom negotiated contracts, it is mostly unregulated, and exposed to default risk
    - Default risk it the risk that either party default(fail to comply) from the agreement
- Derivatives can be classified according to the nature of the contract
  - Forward commitment - A contract where the parties are required to perform some action at a given
  - Contingent claim - consists of a payoff which is only claimable if a particular event happens before the expiry of the contract
- `Hedge` - utilize derivatives to reduce risks
- `Spectating` - utilize derivatives to gain capital

#### Forwards

- They are traded Over-the-Counter
- They are forward commitment derivatives
- At the initiation of a forward contract, one party agrees buy an asset from another party on a specified settlement date in the future at a given price(`Forward Price`)
- It requires no payment by either party at initiation
- `Spot Price` is the current market price of the asset
- `Forward Price` is based on the spot price adjusted according by the cost of carry of the asset
- When the contract is initiated the forward price become the `Contract Price`
- Buyer is called the `Long`
- Seller is called the `Short`
- The expected future price is the future spot price adjected by the cost of carrying
  - Overall, long has advantage when expected future price rise and vice versa
- Forward contract specified what happen on the settlement date
  - `Cash Settled Forward Contract`(`Contract for Differences`, `Non-deliverable Forwards`) - When spot price on the settlement date is higher, long pays short the differece only without actually purchasing underlying assets and vice versa
  - `Deliverable Forward` - The short is required to deliver the underlying asset to the long at the contract price no matter what the current spot price is

#### Futures

- Similar to `Forwards`, but Exchange-Traded
- Futures also have some additional terms
- They are forward commitment derivatives
- `Open Interest` - the total number of outstanding contracts that are held by market participants at the end of the day
  - open interest increases when traders enter a new long and short positions and decreases when traders exit existing positions
  - open interest is a measure of the flow of money into the futures market
  - Some speculators look for trading signals based on the open interest for a particular asset
- `Settlement Price` - an average of the prices of the trades during the last period of trading called the closing period
  - it reduces the opportunity of traders to manipulate the settlement price
  - the settlement price is used to calculate the daily gain or loss at the end of each trading day
  - on its final day of trading. The settlement price is equal to the spot price of the underlying asset
- `Margin` - a deposit from long and short to guarantee that all parties will honor their obligations
  - an initial deposit is known as the initial margin the initial margin per contract is relatively low as compared to the size of the contract
  - this margin is deposited in the traders margin account after the futures contract is obtained
  - Changes in the price of the futures contract result in daily gains or losses they are credited to or subtracted from the margin account of the contract holder
    - This is called the marking to market process
  - the maintenance margin is the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained in the margin account, it is less than the initial margin amount
  - if the balance in the account falls below the maintenance margin, additional funds must be deposited to bring the margin balance back up to the initial margin amount
  - Note that this is different from the case of an equity account which requires investors only to bring the margin back up to the maintenance margin amount
- Futures contracts may not meet the exact needs of the participants, but their liquidity and ease of trading makes them an attractive instrument for parties that want to hedge against changes in prices

#### Swaps

- They are traded Over-the-Counter
- They are forward commitment derivatives
- Swaps can be viewed as a series of forwards
- a swap is defined as a contract whereby two parties agree to exchange a series of payments on periodic settlement dates over a certain time period
  - e.g. two parties swap the interest payment of a loan with the same pricipal amount, it is called the plain vanilla interest rate swap(a floating rate payer switch with a fixed rate payer)
  - In a simple interest rate swap, floating rate interest payments are exchanged for fixed rate payments.
  - A currency swap involves a loan in one currency for the loan of another currency for a period of time.
  - An equity swap involves the exchange of the return on an equity index or portfolio for the interest payment on a debt instrument
  - the common pricipals are called the notional principal
  - In a swap contract, two parties agree to pay each other such that the net payment is equivalent to one asset being swapped for another, usually over multiple settlement dates until the expiry
- The contract ends on the expiry date which is usually the date of the last payments to be made
- Each settlement date the difference of period payment is calculated so that only one payment is made
- In swaps, each party is long one asset and short the other, so the designation of the long and short side is often arbitrary
  - Usually the side that benefits from an increase in the quoted price or rate is referred to as the long side and the other side is short

#### Options

- They are Exchange-Traded
- An option contract gives its owner all along the right to buy or sell an asset and a specific exercise price at some specified date in the future
- the long pays, the short a premium to initiate an options contract
- If the long exercises the right, the short who is the writer of the option has the obligation to sell or buy the asset according to the terms of the contract
- on the settlement date, the long the right to buy but not the obligation to buy at a given price for options
  - This price is known as the exercise price or strike price
- To obtain this right an option premium need to be paid, long buys this right from short
- Call option - The long will have the option to buy, short have to sell if long exercises for a specified time period
  - The option Buyer is called the long call, the option seller is called the short call
- Put option - The long will have the option to sell, short have to buy if long exercises for a specified time period
  - The option buyer is called the long put, the option seller is called the short put
- American options may be exercised at any given time up to and including the contracts expiration date,
  - a quick way to remember, `A`(American) stands for `Anytime`
- European options can only be exercised on the contracts expiration date
  - a quick way to remember, `E`(European) stands for `Expiration`
- Contingent claim derivatives can be defined as an option with payoff
  - The payoff here is the profit of the long
  - a event is when the market price of the asset is higher than the exercise price
- The short is the writer of the contract and the long is the holder of the contract.
  - Call options, give the long the right to buy the underlying from the short
  - Put options, give the long the right to sell the underlying to the short

#### Credit Derivatives

- They are Exchange-Traded
- They are Contingent claim derivatives
  - The payoff here is a payout that compensates the owner in the event of a downgrade or default by a named borrower
- `Credit Default Swap`(CDE)
  - It is a type of credit derivatives
  - an insurance contract against default, a bond holder pays regular premiums to a credit protection seller if the bond issuer defaults the bond holder receives a payout that can compensate for some of the financial loss from the default
- `Credit Spread Option` - the underlying is the credit spread on a bond
  - It is a type of credit derivatives
  - `Credit Spread` is the bonds yield spread relative to a benchmark
  - a bond holder typically pays a premium to buy this call option to be compensated if the bonds credit quality decreases
  - The bond holder chooses the strike level of the option, when a bond is credit quality decreases its yield spread will increase
  - on the expiration of the call option if the yield spread is above the strike the bond holder will collect to pay off based on the difference this pay off compensates the bond holder for the drop in market price of the bond

#### Insurance

- A type of contract
- Pay a premium to the insurer to hedge against the risk of an unfavorable event that may occur in the future before an expiration date. If the event occurs before the contract expiration, you receive a cash payout that compensates you for the financial loss due to the event.
- Common insurance contracts include
  - Life
  - Liability
  - Automobile insurance
- Some insurance contracts can be traded to other parties
- Credit default swap - A credit default swap makes a payment of an issuer defaults on its bonds. They can be used by bond investors to hedge default risk. They can also be used by parties that will experience losses if the bond defaults
  - Credit default swaps also attract interest from speculators who want to bet on the probability of an issuer defaulting on its bonds

### Pooled Investment Vehicles

- Any of the above investment method can be combined and used as pooled investment vehicles
- The term refers to structures that combine the funds of many investors to build up a portfolio of investments
- The investors ownership interests can be referred to as shares units, depository receipts or limited partnership interests
- It can be mutual funds, exchange traded funds, asset backed securities or hedge funds,

#### Mutual Funds

- Mutual Funds collects money from individual investors and hires a manager to invest in various assets
  - It incur some management fee
  - When the mutual fund are used to track an index, it is called an index mutual funds. It has a lower management fee(MER or Expense Ratio)
- Mutual funds need to be purchased directly from a mutual fund company, a bank, or a broker
- Mutual funds can be open ended or closed ended.
  - Open ended funds issue new shares when an investor buys in and redeem existing shares, when an investor sells, usually on a daily basis
    - price of shares = net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio divided by the total number of shares.
    - Investors generally buy and sell open ended mutual funds by trading with a mutual fund.
  - Closed ended funds issue shares in primary market offerings. Once issued, it can only trade with other investors on the secondary market, usually at a discount

#### ETFs

- ETFs is similar to index mutual funds and it can be exchanged like a stock with a management fee much lower than mutual funds
- When an ETF tracks a forenign market it can be either:
  - Hedged - The price of the fund is only reflected by the tracked security values
    - Extra work is required for the manager to cancel out the fluctation of the currency exchange rate, so it has a higher management fee
  - Unhedge - The price of the fund is reflected by both the tracked security values and currency exchange rate
    - It allows the investor to invest in currency exchange market at the same time, can increase diversity
- Investors trade their shares in the secondary market.
- The market price is actually quite close to the net asset value of the portfolio.
  - Because, ETFs have special provisions allowing some authorized participants (APs) to convert their shares into individual portfolio securities when the price is significantly below NAV or exchange of portfolio shares for ETF shares when the price is significantly above NAV. Such activities help to keep the market price of the ETF close to the NAV per share of the portfolio.
- ETFs are sometimes referred to as depositories, with their shares referred to as depository receipts.

#### Asset Backed Securities

- Securities whose values and income payments are derived from a pool of assets
- Assets include:
  - Mortgages
  - Credit card debt
  - Car loans
- The interest and principal repayments on these loans are passed through to investors with different classes of claims and levels of risk based on the seniority of the security held by the investor

## Alternative

- Alternative investment does anything that traditional investment donesn't focus on
  - Traditional investment focuses on stocks and bonds investment
  - The investment structure for traditional investments tends to be straightforward between the issuer and investor
- Alternative assets are of interest to investors because of their potential diversification benefits
- Alternative investment portfolios can often include derivatives and illiquid assets such as real estate
- Alternative investment utilzes leverage and employ short positions
  - leverage - borrow money to invest, in order to amplify returns
- Compare with traditional investments, alternative investments have higher management fees on average and often with additional incentive fees based on performance
- alternative investments have low returns correlations with traditional investments
- the assets held and the portfolio as a whole are generally less liquid than traditional investments
- They have more specialization by investment managers
- They have less regulation and transparency
- They have different legal issues and tax treatments and more problematic and less available historical return and volatility data
- a common structure (hedge funds and private equity funds) is a partnership where the fund is the general partner and the investor is a limited partner
- The purpose of alternative investment - adding assets with low correlation of returns with a portfolio can have the effect of reducing the overall portfolio risk
- Risk measures like standard deviation that used for traditional assets may not be adequate to capture the risk characteristics of alternative investments when considering potential portfolio
  combinations
- Historical downside frequencies and worst return in a month may be included in the analysis besides low return correlation historical returns for alternative investments have been higher on average than for traditional investments.
- Adding alternative investments to the portfolio may increase expected returns
  - alternative investments are less efficiently priced than traditional assets. This provides opportunities for skilled managers to outperform.
  - alternative investments gives higher returns as a compensation for being illiquid
  - alternative investments often use leverage which has the effect of increasing the risk and returns
- alternative investments have higher historical returns than traditional investments can be biased to the most common biases
  - survivorship bias - refers to the upward bias of returns if only the data for surviving firms is included
  - backfill bias - backfill bias can be introduced when new funds are added to a benchmark index, since funds that are newly added to an index tend to be those that have outperformed better than average, including their returns for prior years tends to bias the index returns upward

### Hedge Fund

- Hedge funds are private investment vehicles that manage portfolios of securities and derivative positions using a variety of strategies:
  - long and short positions
  - highly leveraged
  - independent of broad market performance
- they do not necessarily hedge risk as the name might imply, and they tend to take on higher risks in the pursuit of generating high returns
- Characteristics:
  - aggressively managed portfolio
  - across asset classes
  - across regions
  - highly leveraged
  - long/short positions
  - uses of derivatives
- complex nature of fund transactions leads managers to trade through prime brokers who provide many services including custodial services, administrative services, money lending, securities lending for short sales and trading services
  - hedge fund managers can negotiate various service parameters with the prime brokers such as margin requirements
- Return objectives can be:
  - absolute basis, for example 15 percent per annum
  - relative basis - against a specific benchmark, for example beating the S&P 500 by 5 percent
- it is usually set up as a limited partnership with the investors as the limited partners, and the management firm as the general partner
- a hedge fund partnership may be limited to just a prescribed number of investors
  - possess adequate wealth
  - sufficient liquidity
  - acceptable degree of investment sophistication
- the management firm hires fund manager to manage the fund, they typically receives both a management fee based on the value of the portfolio and an incentive fee based on fund returns
  - They try to add value by utilizing various strategies, and leverage is often used to amplify the gains
- hedge fund investments are less liquid than traditional investments
  - lockup period - investors are required to keep their money in the hedge fund for a minimum period before they are allowed to make redemptions
  - investors may be required to give notice of their intent to redeem the notice period is typically 30 to 90 days in length and the investors may be charged a fee to redeem the shares
- a fund of hedge funds is an investment company that invests in hedge funds giving investors diversification among hedge fund strategies
  - it allows smaller investors to access hedge funds in which they may not be able to invest directly
  - it charges an additional layer of fees beyond the fees charged by the individual hedge funds in the portfolio
- Hedge funds can be classified according to the strategies that the fund manager employs
  - event driven strategies
    - seek to profit from short term events typically raised on a corporate restructuring or corporate acquisition
    - Hedge funds typically profit from such opportunities through long and short positions in common and preferred stocks as well as debt securities and options of the companies involved
    - event driven strategies can be further sub categorized as follows:
      - Merger Arbitrage is the strategy of selling short the shares of an acquiring firm and buying the shares of the firm being acquired
        - An acquisition is when one company purchases most or all of another company's shares to gain control of that company with or without the target company's approval
        - The hedge fund manager seeks to profit from the deal spread which reflects the uncertainty of the deal closing.
          - It could also be that the manager expects the acquirer to ultimately overpay for the acquisition and its share price suffer
        - The primary risk in this strategy is that the announced acquisition does not occur
      - Distressed/Restructuring is the strategy of buying the securities of firms in financial distress or close to bankruptcy
        - If the hedge fund manager feels that the distressed firm is likely to be successfully restructured he/she buys the company's shares hoping that the share price will recover
        - When the prospects of the company will worsen resulting in a widening spread between the riskier and less risky securities of the company
          - fund manager might long the senior debt and short junior debt or buy preferred stock and short common stock
      - Activist shareholder is the strategy of influencing a company's policies with a goal of increasing the company's value
        - If the hedge fund manager finds a promising firm he'll buy sufficient shares in public market, then he will have the rights to influence on the firm's policies and uses strategies to help the company grow
      - special situations is the strategy of investing in the securities of firms that are currently engaged in restructuring activities like
        - issuing or repurchasing securities
        - spinning off divisions
        - selling assets
        - distributing capital
  - relative value strategies
    - it involves buying a security and selling short a related security with the goal of profiting when a perceived pricing discrepancy between the two is resolved.
    - the strategy is to exploit pricing discrepancies between two or more related securities, includes:
      - Fixed income convertible arbitrage - exploit pricing discrepancies between convertible bonds and the common stock of the issuing companies
      - Fixed income asset backed to exploit pricing discrepancies among various mortgage backed securities or asset backed securities.
      - Fixed Income general to exploit pricing discrepancies between fixed income securities of various types.
      - Volatility to exploit pricing discrepancies arising from differences between returns volatility implied by options prices and manager expectations of future volatility
      - Multi strategy which is to exploit pricing discrepancies among securities across asset classes and markets other than those already mentioned
  - macro strategies
    - it is based on global economic trends and events.
    - The hedge fund manager may take long or short positions in equities, fixed income, currencies, or commodities based on his view on overall market direction for each of these asset classes
      strategies are said to have a top down approach as the investment decisions are made at the macro level
  - equity hedge strategies
    - it employs a bottom up approach where investment decisions are made according to the views on individual securities
    - Hedge fund managers apply their views on individual companies through long or short positions in publicly traded equities and equity derivative securities.
    - Examples of equity hedge strategies include
      - Market neutral where technical or fundamental analysis is used to select undervalued equities to be held long and to select overvalued equities to be sold short
        - the long and short positions are taken in approximately equal amounts to profit from their relative price movements with minimal exposure to market risk
      - Quantitative directional is the use of just technical analysis to long equity securities believed to be undervalued and short securities believed to be overvalued
        - Unlike market neutral the managers do not strive to make the long and short positions equal
      - Fundamental growth is the use of fundamental analysis to find high growth companies. Hedge fund managers seek to identify and buy equities of companies that are expected to sustain relatively high rates of capital appreciation
      - Fundamental value is also the use of fundamental analysis to buy equity shares. But instead of focusing on high growth companies, fundamental value managers look out for undervalued companies to invest in
      - Short bias is the strategy of using technical or fundamental analysis to take predominantly short positions in overvalued equities. The hedge funds may possibly enter into smaller long positions with the market exposure is overall negative
- Most hedge funds tend to specialize in a specific strategy at first. Over time some may develop or add additional areas of expertise becoming multi-strategy funds.
- Most hedge fund indices equally weight in the returns of the hedge funds included in the index, hedge funds are largely unregulated and are not required to report their performance to index providers. Consequently, some funds will report to one index, but not another, the performance of different indices can thus very substantially. Furthermore, it's often the case that those funds that report are the funds that have good performance, poorly performing funds do not want to publicize their performance. The result is an upward bias in index returns, with hedge funds appearing to be better investments than they actually are

### Private Equity Funds

- Private equity funds invest in the equity of companies that are not publicly traded or in publicly traded firms that the fund intends to take private
  - The majority of private equity funds are `leveraged buyout funds`
    - leveraged buyout funds - use borrowed money to purchase equity in established companies with solid customer bases proven products and high quality management
  - Some private equity funds are venture capitals which typically invest in or provide financing to startups or young companies with high growth potential

    - diversification benefits
  - Disadvantages of direct investment
    - substantial management costs
    - require substantial due diligence
    - There are also illiquid as the investment size can be large and the pool of investors is limited
  - Indirect investments can buy through vehicles such as real estate investment, trust master, limited partnership or stock of firms that have large ownership of real assets. The investor owns an interest in these vehicles, which hold the assets directly in direct ownership. Interests are typically more liquid than ownership of the assets themselves
  - Real Estate Indexes
    - Direct investments have
      - Appraisal Index - measures returns based on appraisals of properties
      - Repeat Sales Index - measured based on repeat property sales
    - Indirect investments have
      - REITs Indexes - updated much more frequently direct investments indexes
        - FTSE International produces a family of REITs indices that seeks to represent trends in real estate worldwide (e.g. FTSE NAREIT Global Index)

### Commodities

- Commodities investments maybe in physical products such as grains metals and crude oil
- to gain exposure to changes in commodities prices:
  - investors can own physical commodities, commodities derivatives, or the shares of commodity producing firms
- to gain exposure to the returns on various commodity indices:
  - investors can hold derivatives contracts that are expected to track a specific commodity index
- Examples
  - Energy products
  - Industrial metals
  - Precious metals
  - Agricultural products
  - Carbon credits
- Spot commodity markets, trade commodities for immediate delivery, whereas the forward and futures markets trade commodities for future delivery.
- The producers and processors of commodity products are the primary users of the spot commodity markets
  as they are best able to take or make immediate deliveries.
- Many producers employ financial analysts to help them analyze commodity market conditions so that they can best manage their inventories to hedge their operational risks and to speculate on future price changes.
- Many of the producers and consumers of commodities take opposite sides in futures and forward contracts to hedge against change in price in the future.
- Commodity indices represent futures contracts on commodities such as agriculture, metals and energy
- The contracts mature and must be replaced over time by other contracts, so the return on commodity futures could be quite different from the return based on changes in the prices of the commodities
- Weighting Scheme
  - Some commodity index providers use equal weighting
    - The Commodity Research Bureau Index
  - Some other indices weight based on global production values
    - The S&P GSCI uses a combination of liquidity measures and global production values in its weighting scheme
  - Others use fixed weights that the index provider determines

### Infrastructure

- Infrastructure refers to long lived assets that provide public services.
- These include economic infrastructure assets such as airports, utility grids, and social infrastructure assets such as schools and hospitals
- Investors may directly invest into individual products or gain exposure indirectly through

  - Primary reserve currencies are the U.S. dollar and the Euro.
  - Secondary reserve currencies include the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.
- Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets
- In spot currency transactions, one currency is immediately exchanged for another
  - The rate of exchange is called the spot exchange rate.
- Now exchange of currencies does not need to be transacted immediately. Two parties can agree on a fixed rate to exchange out on a date in the future
  - This can be arranged by means of a contract

## Portfolio Management

- An investment portfolio contains a selection of investments with different weights, in order to control the risks
- Debt securities and equity securites market are negatively correlated(hedged), so investing in a combination of bonds and stocks is popular, and the portfolio can be described as the following allocation models when only considering invest in bonds and stocks:
  - An income portfolio consists primarily of dividend-paying stocks and coupon-yielding bonds where stocks takes from `0%` to `30%`
  - A balanced portfolio invests in both stocks and bonds to reduce potential volatility where stocks takes from `40%` to `60%`
  - A growth portfolio consists of mostly stocks where stocks takes from `70%` to `100%`
- A portfolio needs to be diversified to distribute risks using the following options:
  - select stocks that have different company cap size
  - select stocks that varies in types like growth stock and income stock, and location
  - select stocks from different stock exchange
  - select stocks from different sector

### Financial Reporting Analysis

    - Forward-looking expenditures and divestitures
  - In the United States, The FCC requires that the management discuss trends and identify significant events and uncertainties for publicly traded companies
- Framework(Steps) for Financial Statement Analysis:
  1. State the objective and context prior to undertaking an analysis
     - determine what are the questions that the analysis seeks to answer
     - The form in which this information needs to be presented
     - what resources and how much time are available to perform the analysis
  2. Gathers the data required to answer the specific questions
     - acquire the company's financial statements
     - acquire other relevant data on its industry and the economy
     - interview the company's management suppliers and customers and visit companies sites to obtain a qualitative understanding of the company's business competitive stance and future directions
  3. Process the data into meaningful metrics for analysis.
     - Make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements to facilitate comparison against other companies or the industry average
     - Calculate the company ratios and prepare exhibits such as graphs and common size balance sheets
  4. Analyze and interpret the output
     - seeks to answer the questions stated in the first step with the supporting information
     - decides what conclusions or recommendations the information supports
  5. Prepare a report
     - Highlight the conclusions or recommendations with the supporting information
       - report and its dissemination comply with the code and standards that relate to investment analysis and recommendations
         - A critical part of this standard is to distinguish clearly between opinions and facts.
  6. Update the analysis
     - Periodic reviews and updates by repeat the entire process from step 1
- All of the following report can provide useful information for analysis. However, an analyst should also review pertinent information on economic conditions and the company's industry and compare the company to its competitors, this information can be acquired from:
  - Trade Journals
  - Statistical Reporting Services
  - Government Agencies

#### Standards Setting Bodies

- Standards setting bodies are professional not for profit organizations that establish financial reporting standards
- Desirable attributes of standard setting bodies:
  - all parties involved in the standard settings process should observe high professional standards
    - including standards of ethics and confidentiality
  - have adequate authority resources and competencies to fulfill its responsibilities
  - Have clear and consistent standard-setting processes
  - Guided by a well-articulated framework with a clearly stated objective
  - operate independently seeking and considering input from stakeholders but making decisions that are consistent with the stated objective of the framework
  - The decision setting process should not be compromised by pressure from external forces. It should also not be influenced self or special interests.
  - Decisions and resulting standards should be made in the public interest.
- the `International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)` sets Financial Reporting Standards that have been adopted in many countries
  - A standards setting body
  - Widely adopted outside the U.S
  - The `IASB` establishes the `International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)` a standard widely followed by firms outside of the US
  - `IASB` replaced `International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)` in
    - `IASC` issued the `International Accounting Standard (IAS)`. While some rules from `IAS` is still in use, `IASB` replace some of `IAS` by `IFRS`
- `Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)`
  - A standards setting body
  - Widely adopted in the U.S
  - `FASB` establishes the generally accepted accounting principles, known as `US GAAP`

#### Financial Reporting Standards

- Standard setters are working to achieve convergence of financial reporting standards
- To keep up to date on the evolving standards an analyst can monitor professional journals and the `IASB` and `FASB` websites, or position papers on financial reporting issues through the CFA Institute Center for Financial marketing integrity

##### IFRS

- it is a framework is the base of `IASB`'s standards and their requirements for financial statements.
- `IASB` set its standards in the `Conceptual Framework(2010) for Financial Reporting`
  - The framework is designed to assist:
    - standard setters in developing and reviewing standards
    - preparers of financial statements in applying standards and in dealing with issues not specifically covered by standards
    - auditors in forming an opinion on financial statements
    - users in interpreting financial statement information
  - The core of the conceptual framework is the objective to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors, in making decisions about providing resources to the entity includes:
    - the entities financial position
    - financial performance
    - company's cash flow
  - The framework defines usefulness, the information is useful if:
    - it is Relevant - information should have predictive, value confirmatory value or both
      - Materiality is an aspect of relevance.
    - it has been faithfully represented. Such information is complete neutral and free from error.
  - There are four characteristics that enhance relevance and faithful representation
    - compatibility - the financial statement presentation is consistent among firms and across time periods
    - verifiability - independent observers will arrive at similar conclusions if they use the same methods
    - timeliness - the information is available to decision makers before it becomes stale
    - understandability - users should be able to readily understand the information the statements present
  - The framework defines the reporting elements that should be included
    - financial position mearsuring elements
      - assets
        - resources controlled as a result of past transactions.
        - expected to provide future economic benefits
      - liabilities
        - a result of past events
        - expected to require an outflow of economic resources in the future
      - owners equity
        - Equity is the owner's residual interest in the assets After deducting the liabilities
    - performance measuring elements
      - income
        - an increase in economic benefits, either increasing assets or decreasing liabilities in a way that increases owners equity, includes `comprehensive income`, `revenues`, and `gains`
      - expenses
        - decreasing assets or increasing liabilities in a way that decreases owners equity
        - `losses` are to be included in expenses
  - the framework also states that an item should be recognized in the balance sheet or
    income statement if a future economic benefit from the item is probable and the items value or cost can be measured reliably
    - the amounts at which such items are to be reported depend on the measurement base
      - measurement bases include historical cost a motorized cost current cost realizable value present value and fair value
  - the framework states two important underlying assumptions in financial statements
    - accrual accounting - financial statements should reflect transactions at the time they actually occur not necessarily when cash is paid
    - growing concern - assumes the company will continue to exist for the forseeable future
      - If this is not the case then presenting the company's financial position fairly requires a number of adjustments. For example it's inventory or other assets may only be worth their liquidation values
  - The framework defines constraint
    - the cost of providing the information
      - optimally benefits derived from the information should exceed the costs.
      - The aim is to achieve a balance between costs and benefits
    - non quantifiable information like reputation brand loyalty and innovation cannot be captured directly in financial statements
  - The framework does not address the contents of the financial statements
- The `IAS No.1` defines details like which financial statements are required, Their general features and their structure and content, as:
  - Required financial statements
    - balance sheet
    - statement of comprehensive income
      - It can be presented as a single statements or separately as an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income
    - statement of changes in owners equity
    - statement of cash flows
    - notes, summarising accounting policies and disclosing other items
  - General features
    - fair presentation - faithfully representing the effects of the entity's transactions and events
    - going concern basis - the financial statements are based on the assumption that the firm will continue to exist
    - accrual basis - it is used to prepare the financial statements other than the statement of cash flows
    - materiality - the financial statements should be free of misstatements or omissions like good influence the decisions of relevant parties, aggregation of similar items and separation of dissimilar items
    - No offsetting - No offsetting of assets against liabilities or income against expenses unless a specific standard permits or requires it.
    - Frequency of Reporting - frequency must be at least annually
    - comparative information for prior periods should be included unless a specified standard states otherwise
    - consistency - between periods in how items are presented and classified with prior period amounts disclosed for comparison
  - Structure and Content
    - classified balance sheet showing current and non-current assets and liabilities
    - Minimum information is required on the face of each financial statement
      - For example the face of the balance sheet must show specific items such as cash and cash equivalents, plant property and equipment and inventories
    - Minimum specified no disclosures - The standard specifies disclosures about information to be presented in the footnotes
    - This information must be provided in a systematic manner and cross referenced from the face of the financial statements
    - Comparative information for prior period should be included unless a specified standard states otherwise

##### US GAAP

- Many aspects of `IFRS` and `US GAAP` have converged over the past decade
- Compare to `IFRS`, `US GAAP` has the following difference:
  - only revenue and expenses are listed as elements related to performance
  - `US GAAP` defines an asset as a resource for which a future economic benefit is expected to flow.
    - The `FASB` defines it simply as a future economic benefit(probable)
  - `US GAAP` allow the upward valuation of most assets, but `FASB` doesn't
  - still disagree on the best treatment of certain items or issues
    - certain business groups place pressures to block any changes in accounting practices that may not be in their best interest
- In many cases however a company will present a reconciliation statement showing what its financial results would have been under an alternative reporting system

#### Regulatory Authorities

- Regulatory Authorities are governmental entities that have the legal authority to enforce financial reporting requirements
  - `U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)` enforce the standards in the U.S.
    - The `SEC` no longer requires `IFRS` reporting firms to reconcile their financial statements to `US GAAP`
    - It requires the listed companies to file standardized forms regularly.
      - form `S-1` a registration statement filed prior to the sale of new securities to the public
      - Form `10-K` which is a required annual filing similar to that which a firm typically provides in its annual report to shareholders
        - The forms `40-F` and `20-F` are the equivalent `10-K` for Canadian and other foregin issuer respectively
      - Form `10-Q` which U.S. firms are required to file quarterly with updated financial statements which need not be audited
        - Non-US companies are typically required to file the equivalent forms `6-K` semiannually
      - form `DEF-14A` is to be filed when a company prepares a proxy statement for its shareholders prior to the annual meeting or other shareholder vote
      - form `8-K` is to be filed to disclose material events like significant asset acquisition or disposal and changes in management
      - form `144` is a notification to the `SEC` when a company issues securities to certain qualified buyers
      - form `3,4,5` include the beneficial ownership of securities by a companie's offices and directors
  - `European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)` - a European Union financial regulatory agency and European Supervisory Authority, located in Paris
- The `SEC` and `ESMA` are members of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (`OICV-IOSCO`)
  - `OICV-IOSCO` is not a regulatory authority but its members regulate a significant portion of the world's financial capital markets
  - has a goal of uniform financial regulations across countries
- According to IFCO the three objectives of financial market regulation are:
  - Protect investors
  - Ensure the fairness efficiency and transparency of markets
  - Reduce systematic risk

##### International Financial Reporting Standards

#### Balance Sheet

- a snapshot of the firm's financial position
- It has three components:
  - Assets - resources owned by the company(e.g. Equipment, Cash)
  - Liability - amount borrowed from others
  - Owner's Equity - it equals `Assets - Liability`

#### Income Statement

- It accounts the net income of a company for a certain period
- `Net Income = Revenue - Expenses + Other Income`
  - `Revenue` - inflows from delivering or producing goods and services and other activities
  - `Expenses` - outflows in the processes of running operations that generates revenue including depreciation of assets and concurrence of liabilities
  - `Other Income` - inflows that is not from the ordinary course of the business

#### Comprehensive Income Statement

- It accounts the gains and losses that are excluded from the income statement, e.g.
  - Unrealized gains on losses on investments that are classified as available for
    sale
  - Foreign currency translation gains or losses
  - Pension plan gains or losses
- Optionally, comprehensive income statement can combine with net income statement as a `Total Comprehensive Income Statement`

#### Changes in Equity

- `Net Changes in Equity` is the amount of the changes in Owner's Equity between two balance sheet from one period to its next
- `Net Changes in Equity = Total Comprehensive Income - Changes in Equity`
- It explains the changes in equity
  - e.g. the shareholder transactions like dividend payout

#### Statement of Cashflows

- A disclosure of the sources and uses of cash, and the net cashflow should matches the changes in balance cash on the balance sheet from one period to the next, it evaluates company's liquidity
- Net cashflows are consisted of three sections:
  - Operation Cashflows - activities cashs related to the transactions occurred during normal business
  - Investments Cashflows - activities related to the purchase and sell of long-term assets
  - Financing Cashflows - activities related to obtaining or repaying captial

#### Auditor's Reports

- an audit is an independent review of a firms financial statements
  - The objective of an audit is to enable the auditor to provide an opinion on the fairness and reliability of the financial statements
  - The auditor examines the company's accounting and internal control systems confirms assets and liabilities and determines that there are no material errors in the financial statements.
- An audit will be completed by an independent certified public accountant, appointed by the board of directors
- The standard auditor's opinion contains three key elements:
  - They are the financial statements are prepared by the management and are its responsibility
  - Generally accepted auditing standards were followed, thus providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements contained no material errors
  - An opinion will be given from the audit on whether the statements were prepared in accordance with accepted accounting principles, the opinion can be

### Technical Analysis

- It is a combination of art and science, of forecasting the future price movement, that is based on an examination of the past price movements
- It works for all tradable instrucments which have prices fluctuated overtime
- Technical Analysis only focuses on the actual price movement, any consideration other than the price movement like financial reports and news are part of the fundamental analysis
- It is a type of quantitaive analysis, a part of fundamental analysis that doesn't rely on numbers are qualitative analysis
- The Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis
  - The market discounts everything - The final price of an aset on the market has taken everything into consideration including market psychology(Efficient Markets Hypothesis)
  - Price moves in trends - A price trend can always be identifid in a efficient and transparent market
  - History tends to repeat itself - the standing point of chart patterns analysis
- Types of charts
  - Line charts - it plots the closing price over time
    - A local maxima is called a peak, a local minima is called a trough
  - Bar charts - it plots a bar for the price action of each day, the highest daily price is at top of the bar and lowest daily price at the bottom of the bar, the bar is also colored in green and red to show the overall rise and fall
    - Daily bar charts - it indicates the opening price on the left on the bar and closing price on the right
  - Candlesticks charts - it plots bars which demostrate prices bounded by the opening and closing prices and use extended lines(called shadows) to show the highest and lowest prices for a selected time frame
    - time frame can be any time intervals based on the platform software
    - Doji candles are candles that describe the same open and closing prices
    - When it has no upper and lower shadow it is called Marubozu candles
  - Heikin Ashi charts - similar to Candlesticks but it uses the midpoint of the previous candle body as open value and use the average of open-high-low-close (OHLC) of the current period as close value
    - It is the refined version of Candlesticks charts that filters out noises
- There are different types of trading each with different focuses on the time frame:
  - Intraday Trading - Hold trades for few minutes to few hours but not overnight
    - Scalping - Hold trades for only few seconds or few minutes
  - Positional Trading - Holds trades overnight from a few days to few months
    - Intermediate - Hold trades for few weeks to few months but less than one year
    - Short Term(Swing Trading) - Hold trades for few days to few weeks
  - Long Term investment(Long-term Positional Trading) - Hold trades for more than one year
- Online analysis platform like [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com) is a popular choice for technical analysis

#### Trend Analysis

- The trend of the price shows the relationship of demand of supply, the trend only changes when an external force is applied
- Trend can be:
  - Uptrend - the overall price has higher highs, and higher lows
  - Downtrend - the overal price has lower lows, and lower highs
  - Sideways trend - a horizontal trend during the transition period between uptrends and downtrends
- The prices alway fluctuate within a trend, short term trading can take advantages of this property
- A trend that last for 5 to 20 years is called a secular trend
- Trends can be categorized by time frame
  - Major trend - long-term trend
  - Intermediate trend - 1 to 3 months trend within the major trend
  - Minor trend - trend within one month with the intermediate trend
- Stages are determined by the transation of trends
  - Stage 1 - The sideways trend after a downtrend
    - it is a consolidation phase that can be called a accumulation phase when price increases slowly
  - Stage 2 - The uptrend after stage 1
  - Excess Phase - sometimes exists in between stage 2 and stage 3, this price suddenly rises and it is a sign of stage 3
    - Exhaustion Phase always follows the excess phase, is a sudden price drop after the excess phase
    - Excess Phase and Exhaustion Phase together, are sometimes recognized as two main parts of a stage 3
  - Stage 3 - The sideways trend after an uptrend
    - It's a consolidation phase that can be a accumulation phase if price goes up or distribution phase if price goes down
  - Stage 4 - The downtrend after stage 3
- Trendline is one of the most important tools in technical analysis
  - Join all troughs will create the trend line for an uptrend(also known as support), and join the peaks for a downtrend(also known as resistance)
    - Support or resistance are dynamic for uptrend and downtrend, when it is horizontal(sideways trendlines) it is a static support or resistance
    - Sometimes resistance can changed to a support level when price goes up, or vice versa
    - the faster the prices change the more likely the prices will break the trendlines
    - Volumn spikes drive the price to break the trendlines
  - When the price is crossing the trendline, a trend is changing
    - it can change back to the same trend but with a different slope
  - Main Trand line with longer time frame can be intersected by an internal trendline with a shorter time frame
  - It is better to use logrithmic scale for the y-asix to draw the trend line
    - the space between larger numbers are smaller
  - The points used to draw trendlines should be evenly spaced
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a hanging man pattern which is a red bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
  - The local minima can be indicated by a hammer man pattern which is a green bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the dragonfly candle
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a shooting star pattern which is a red bar with long upper shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small lower shadow in the candlesticks chart, it ususlly follows a green bar
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the gravestone candle
  - Marubozu shows confidence in growth when green and decrease when red
- Fibonacci retracement

#### Indicators

- They can be categorized as:
  - lagging indicator - it is a financial sign that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place. Therefore, lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them
  - leading indicator - it corresponds with a future movement or change in some phenomenon of interest. It helps to predict and forecast future events and trends
  - oscillator - a line graph that moves between two extremes

##### Lagging Indicator

- Moving Average - indicates changes in trend
  - It calculates and, for each day, it plots the average of all previous prices in a given time frame over the price chart
  - Exponentional moving average(EMA) is preferred, it reacts quicker to small price changes
  - Simple moving average is suitable for big time frames
  - 200 days moving average is popular
    - Bull lives above(current prices are higher than average price) the a average chart, Bear lives below(current prices are lower than average price) the a average chart
    - It can also act as a support and resistent level
  - It only provides valuable information when martket is in trend
  - The intersections between moving average charts for various length of time frame can be used to indicate turning points
  - Different trading types use different period:
    - Long Term Investor - uses 200, 100, 50 periods
    - Positional Trader - uses 50, 21, 14 periods
    - Intraday Trader - uses 14, 7, 3 periods
- Moving Average Convergence/Divergence(MACD) - indicates changes in trend
  - It is also recognized as a momentum oscillator
  - It shows the postive or negative difference between a "fast" (short period) EMA, and a "slow" (longer period) EMA, in a bar chart
  - When the difference is positive the price goes up, otherwise, the price goes down

##### Oscillator

- The relative strength index (RSI) - It is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset
  - It can have a reading from 0 to 100, high RSI value(above 70) represents overbought,low RSI value(below 30) represents oversold
  - when above 50, it is an uptrend, when below 50, it is a downtrend
- The A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time
  - It is consisted of K line and D line ranging from 0 to 100
  - When K line cross above D line around 20, it is a buy signal
  - When K line cross below D line around 80, it is a sell signal
  - Whenever two lines falls below 20, it a signal of oversold. When two lines goes above 80, it is a signal of overbought
  - Sharpe bottom and broad top represents an uptrend and vice versa
  - Short-term market players tend to choose low settings for all variables, and vice versa

##### Fibanacci Retracement

- It is used to predict support level in a clear uptrend or downtrend
- The ratio of the adjecent number in a fibonacci series will approach to the golden ratio(`1.618`)
- The ratio used in the Fibanacci retracement tools are:
  - `0`
  - `0.236`, which is from `0.618-0.382`
  - `0.328`, which is from `1 - 0.618` or `0.618 * 0.618`
  - `0.5`, one half
  - `0.618`, which is the inverse of a golden ratio `1/1.618`, it is called the golden mean `0.618`
  - `0.786`, which is the square root of `0.618`
  - `0.88`
  - `1`
  - Extension Level 1 - `1.272`, which is the square root of `1.618`
  - Extension Level 2 - `2.618`, which is from `1.618 * 1.618`
  - Extension Level 3 - `4.236`, which is from `2.618 * 1.618`
- The ratio should be drawn between the peak and trough(a swing) from `1` to `0`
  - `1` should be at the trough for an uptrend
  - `1` should be at the peak for an downtrend
  - Usually, draw from left to right when using analysis platform softwares
- After drawing the scale, each ratio level can be treated as potential support level, since buyers tend to trade when those level are reached
- Draw the scale in a reverse order(from right to left) to use the extension levels, extension levels indicates the target prices(the next peak in an uptrend or the next trough in a downtrend)
- It is suggest to apply the scale on the current swing(the lastest known swing), and analysis on higher timeframe
  - When new swing forms draw the new scale on the new swing

- For people with high risk tolerance, the time horizon need to be longer
- Comparing risks among each types of securities, `Equity > Debt`
- Investing in stocks from small cap companies is more risker
