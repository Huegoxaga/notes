# Finance

- Finance, as a discipline, derived from ecomonics; it involves assessing money, banking, credit, investments, and other aspects of the financial systems

## Introduction

### Functions of the Financial System

1. Help its participants achieve their purposes in using the financial system
   - The participants in the financial system are primarily individuals, firms and governments
   - Purposes of the participants in using the financial system are:
     - Save
       - Individuals typically save for retirement and expect a return that compensates them for risk and the use of their money
       - Firm save a portion of their sales to fund future expenditures, instruments used for saving include stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit or real assets such as real estate
     - Borrow
       - Individuals often borrow in order to buy a house, fund a college education or for other purposes
       - Governments may borrow by issuing debt to fund their expenditures
       - Firms may borrow in order to finance capital expenditures and for other activities
     - Issue equity
       - Firms can raise capital by issuing equity where the capital providers become shareholders of the company and will share in any future profits
       - The financial system facilitates raising equity capital through
         - investment banks which help with issuance
         - analysts value the equity
         - reporting requirements and accounting standards, ensure the production of meaningful financial disclosures
     - Manage risks
       - Changing interest rates
       - Currency values
       - Commodity values
       - Defaults on debt
     - Exchange assets
       - The above risks can often be managed by trading contracts that serve as hedges for the risks.
       - Difference from spot market trading is more common and convenient to trade in an organized market governed by the financial system
         - spot market trading - trade directly with one another
     - Utilize information
       - Not all market participants, however, have an operational need to trade in the financial market
       - Some people trade based on information that they believe allows them to predict future prices
2. Determine the rates of return
   - the rates should equate the total supply of savings with the total demand for borrowing
   - Borrowing and lending can be viewed as demand and supply of money in the financial system.
   - The demand and supply are highly affected by the rate of return or interest rates
   - equilibrium interest rate - the rate at which the amount the borrowers desire is equal to the amount that the lenders desire
   - In many countries, the central bank plays an important role in guiding this equilibrium rate through monetary policy
3. allocate capital to its most efficient uses
   - As capital is limited, the financial system should be structured such that funds are allocated to uses that are most productive
   - In market based economies, lenders determine directly or indirectly which borrower obtains capital.Borrowers who have better credit ratings are perceived as being less risky. So lenders with a lower risk appetite will be fine with lending, even though the rate of return is lower.
     - This process is efficient only if market information is accurate.
     - The regulators and standard setting bodies have the responsibility to ensure that financial information is accurately reported in the most useful manner

#### Best Condition of the Financial System

- The financial system is best at fulfilling these roles when
  - The markets are liquid
  - Transaction costs are low
  - Information is readily available
  - Regulation ensures the execution of contracts

### Types of Market

- Markets can be classifed in the following ways

#### Delivery Method

- Immediate delivery
  - Spot markets
- Future delivery
  - Forward markets
  - Futures markets
  - Options markets - delivery takes place only if the holders of the options choose to exercise them

#### Source

- Primary market - when issuers, which are mainly government or corporate entities, sell new securities to investors.

#### Maturity

- Money markets refer to markets for debt securities with maturities of one year or less, such as
  - repurchase agreements
  - negotiable certificates of deposit
  - government bills
  - commercial paper
- Capital markets refer to markets for longer term debt, securities and equity securities that have no specific maturity date

#### Convention

- Traditional investments include all publicly traded debts and equities and shares in pooled investment vehicles that hold publicly traded debts and or equities like an equity index ETF
- Alternative investments include hedge funds, private equities, commodities, real estate and infrastructure investments, because these investments are often hard to trade and hard to value, they often sell at a discount and require substantial investor due diligence

## Securities

- A security is a financial investment with some monetary value
- It has the following categories:
  - Debt Securities - The majority of debt securities are loans called bonds
  - Equity Securities - The ownership shares of a corporation

- The structured finance sector issues asset backed securities from special legal entities that securitize assets

##### Maturity

- maturity date of a bond is the date on which the principal is to be repaid once a bond has been issued
- the term to maturity (tenor) - The time remaining until maturity date
- Maturity date is the date on which the principal is to be repaid once a bond has been issued
- terms to maturity can be as short as one day or as long as thirty years or more
  - money market securities bonds has original maturities of one year or less
  - capital market securities has original maturities of more than one year
  - perpetual bonds don't have a maturity date
- The time remaining until maturity is referred to as the term to maturity or tenor of a bond, it make periodic interest payments but do not promise to repay the principal amount

##### Par value

- the principal amount that will be repaid at maturity
- It is also referred to as the face value, maturity value, redemption value or principal value of a bond
- bonds prices are commonly quoted as a percentage of par(e.g. bonds qouted as 105 has price which is 105% of the par value)
- a bond that is selling for more than its par value is said to be trading at a premium to par
- a bond that is selling at less than its par value is said to be trading at a discount to par
- a bond that is selling for exactly its par value is said to be trading at par

##### Coupon Rate

- it is the annual percentage of its par value that will be paid to bond holders

##### Frequency

- the frequency the payment is made, calculated from the annual coupon rate
- There are bonds which make annually, semi-annually, quarterly payments or even monthly payments
- The most common is semi-annual payments

##### Currency denomination

- Sometimes borrowers from countries with volatile currencies issue bonds denominated in U.S. dollars
  - U.S. dollar denominated bonds - Both the coupon payments and par value are in U.S. dollars
  - Dual-currency bond makes coupon interest payments in one currency and the principal repayments at maturity in another currency
  - Currency option bond gives bond holders a hoice of which two currencies they would like to receive their payments in

#### Law & Tax

- The legal regulatory and tax considerations that apply to the contract between the issuer and the bond holders

#### Contingency Provisions

- the contingency provisions that may affect the bonds scheduled cash flows
  - These contingency provisions are stated options in the contract
  - they give the issuer or the bondholders certain rights regarding the disposal or redemption of the bond

#### Yield of a Bond

- The price of a bond may fluctuate after it is issued at issuance
- the price of the bond would go back to its par value at maturity
- current yield - the bonds annual coupon divided by the current bonds price
- yield to maturity - an estimate of the annual return when investors hold it until maturity
  - it is the internal rate of return on bonds expected cash flows
  - yield to maturity is inversely related to the purchasing bonds price the higher the bonds price the lower its yield to maturity and vice versa

#### Coupon Structures

- a plain vanilla bond where coupon is paid regularly and the full par value returned on maturity

### Equity

- Equity securities represent ownership in a firm
- Types:
  - Preferred stock - an equity security that pays regular dividends that is typically fixed over the securities life
    - Different from bonds as there is no maturity date and the dividends can only be paid after interest payments to debt holders have been fulfilled
  - Common stock
    - A residual claim on a firm's assets, common stock dividends are paid only after dividends are paid to preferred stock holders. Therefore, dividend payouts are not fixed and are entirely at the discretion of the management
  - Warrants
    - Warrants are similar to options in that they give the holder the right to buy a firm's common stock at the stated exercise price prior to the warrants, expiration warrants are considered equity because they are issued by the company and can potentially become equity if the holder exercises the right to purchase
- In the event of firm liquidation, debt holders have priority over preferred stockholders who in turn have priority over common stockholders
- Stock of a corporation is all of the shares into which ownership of the corporation is divided
  - Similar to shares
- Stocks can be of different types with various rights(voting)
- Stocks can be sold publically on stock exchange
  - An IPO(Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a firm places shares on the public market for the first time
  - A company will hire an underwriter(mostly investment bank) who will help the company to sell the IPO portion of its shares publically
    - Firm Commitment - the underwriter buys all the shares available for sell first, under a guaranteed price
    - Best efforts agreement - the underwriter sells the shares on the company behave without guarantee
  - Regulatory compliance of financial disclosures and transparency is established durint IPO
  - IPO shares can only be purchased through the underwriter with some requirement
    - Primary Market is where investors purchase securities directly from the issuer, e.g. purchasing IPO
    - Secondary Markets is where daily tracsation happens after the securities go public
- A company's value, market cap, or market value in the stock exchange is determined by multiplying the outstanding stocks(number of shares available in the market) by the stock price, the cap ranges are as follows:
  - Large Cap: Greater than `$10` billion
  - Mid Cap: `$2-$10` billion
  - Small Cap: Less than `$2` billion
- The potential value of the company can be determined from its earning, public companies are required to report their earnings four times a year
- A stockbroker or broker buys and sells stocks at the direction of clients. Most buy and sell orders are now made through online discount brokers
- Broker provides two main types of account
  - Cash account - requires that all transactions must be made with available cash or long positions
  - Margin accounts - allow investors to borrow money against the value of the securities in their account
- Supply and demand in the market determine stock price, every time the stock is traded, the price changes
- The profit of trading stocks is from buy at low and sell to high
- Short selling is a way to make profit when stock price drops, the investor borrows shares from a brokers' client and sell it to a new client at a high price, when price drops the investor purchase new shares from the market at a low price then return the shares to its original holder
  - short selling is more risky since there is no limit for price to rise, so the potential loss has no limit
- After-hours trading happens during extended hours when the major exchanges are closed, through computerized trading systems, or electronic markets
  - Not all brokers offer after-hours trading
- companies could buy back shares of their own stock, so the stock prices can increase
- A stock split is when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple new shares to boost the stock's liquidity, and lower the price of the stock
  - The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier
  - Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, combine multiple stocks into one
  - For each shareholder the total shares value on hand keep the same
- Historically, overall stock prices always recover and go up over time with an average annual return around `10%`
- A stock can be categorized by the following types:
  - Income stock - it returns a percentage of the stock prices to the holder quaterly(or monthly determined by the company)
  - Growth stock - A stock with no dividend, the company will use all its profit and the try to grow faster

  - The average volume is the average of the (daily) volumes for a specified period. e.g. `Avg. Volumn(10)` is the 10 days average, `Average Volumn(3m)` is the 3 months average
- Valuation Ratios
  - Price to Earnings(P/E) is the ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS)
    - A lower `P/E` ratio means the stock price is undervalued
  - The price/earnings to growth ratio (PEG ratio) is a stock's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the annual EPS growth rate
    - Any PEG ratio that is smaller than 1.0 is good
  - The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is a ratio that compares a company market cap to its revenue over the past 12 months
  - The price-to-book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value, the book value is the total book value of all the shareholders determined when they buy the shares
  - Dividend yield is a financial ratio that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price
    - this ratio can go up when the stock price drops, since the the pay out amound keeps the same

  - Asset turnover ratio measures the value of a company's sales or revenues relative to the value of its assets
- Liquidity Ratios
  - The current ratio is the proportion of the amount of current assets which only can be sold in one year divided by the amount of current liabilities
    - The higher the better, should be at least great than 1.0
  - The quick ratio is the proportion of the amount of current assets which only can be sold quickly exclude all the inventory divided by the amount of current liabilities
    - This calculation is more conservative than the current ratio
- Debt Ratios
  - The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is calculated by dividing a company’s total liabilities by its shareholder equity
  - Interest coverage ratio can be calculated by dividing a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense
    - Lower than 1.0 is not good

### Contracts

- Contracts are generally agreements between two parties to perform some action in the future
- for financial contracts. These actions are often based on security prices, currency exchange rates, commodity prices or security indexes
- Commonly known as derivatives
- Derivatives can be a contract which is a agreements between two parties to perform some action in the future for financial contracts.
- These actions are often based on security prices, currency exchange rates, commodity prices or security indexes
- Derivatives are a type of securities that derive values from underlyings like assets or securites
  - In reality, the underlying of a derivative can be any know assets like interest rate, foreign currency exchange rates, market indices or other derivatives, or even weather condition
- Derivatives can be `Exchange-Traded` - traded over a central exchange backed by a clearing house
  - Trade with the clearinghouse
  - clearinghouse enforces rules like margins
  - It uses standardized contracts with standard rules and requirement, it is regulated, and generally safer
  - Trades are easy to reverse(quit) or reduce(quit parially), since they can be transferred to others in the market easily
- Derivatives can be traded `Over-the-Counter (OTC)` - traded by dealers without a central location
  - Trade directly with the counterparty
  - It uses custom negotiated contracts, it is mostly unregulated, and exposed to default risk
    - Default risk it the risk that either party default(fail to comply) from the agreement
- Derivatives can be classified according to the nature of the contract
  - Forward commitment - A contract where the parties are required to perform some action at a given
  - Contingent claim - consists of a payoff which is only claimable if a particular event happens before the expiry of the contract
- `Hedge` - utilize derivatives to reduce risks
- `Spectating` - utilize derivatives to gain capital

#### Forwards

- They are traded Over-the-Counter
- They are forward commitment derivatives
- At the initiation of a forward contract, one party agrees buy an asset from another party on a specified settlement date in the future at a given price(`Forward Price`)
- It requires no payment by either party at initiation
- `Spot Price` is the current market price of the asset
- `Forward Price` is based on the spot price adjusted according by the cost of carry of the asset
- When the contract is initiated the forward price become the `Contract Price`
- Buyer is called the `Long`
- Seller is called the `Short`
- The expected future price is the future spot price adjected by the cost of carrying
  - Overall, long has advantage when expected future price rise and vice versa
- Forward contract specified what happen on the settlement date
  - `Cash Settled Forward Contract`(`Contract for Differences`, `Non-deliverable Forwards`) - When spot price on the settlement date is higher, long pays short the differece only without actually purchasing underlying assets and vice versa
  - `Deliverable Forward` - The short is required to deliver the underlying asset to the long at the contract price no matter what the current spot price is

#### Futures

- Similar to `Forwards`, but Exchange-Traded
- Futures also have some additional terms
- They are forward commitment derivatives
- `Open Interest` - the total number of outstanding contracts that are held by market participants at the end of the day
  - open interest increases when traders enter a new long and short positions and decreases when traders exit existing positions
  - open interest is a measure of the flow of money into the futures market
  - Some speculators look for trading signals based on the open interest for a particular asset
- `Settlement Price` - an average of the prices of the trades during the last period of trading called the closing period
  - it reduces the opportunity of traders to manipulate the settlement price
  - the settlement price is used to calculate the daily gain or loss at the end of each trading day
  - on its final day of trading. The settlement price is equal to the spot price of the underlying asset
- `Margin` - a deposit from long and short to guarantee that all parties will honor their obligations
  - an initial deposit is known as the initial margin the initial margin per contract is relatively low as compared to the size of the contract
  - this margin is deposited in the traders margin account after the futures contract is obtained
  - Changes in the price of the futures contract result in daily gains or losses they are credited to or subtracted from the margin account of the contract holder
    - This is called the marking to market process
  - the maintenance margin is the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained in the margin account, it is less than the initial margin amount
  - if the balance in the account falls below the maintenance margin, additional funds must be deposited to bring the margin balance back up to the initial margin amount
  - Note that this is different from the case of an equity account which requires investors only to bring the margin back up to the maintenance margin amount
- Futures contracts may not meet the exact needs of the participants, but their liquidity and ease of trading makes them an attractive instrument for parties that want to hedge against changes in prices

#### Swaps

- They are traded Over-the-Counter
- They are forward commitment derivatives
- Swaps can be viewed as a series of forwards
- a swap is defined as a contract whereby two parties agree to exchange a series of payments on periodic settlement dates over a certain time period
  - e.g. two parties swap the interest payment of a loan with the same pricipal amount, it is called the plain vanilla interest rate swap(a floating rate payer switch with a fixed rate payer)
  - In a simple interest rate swap, floating rate interest payments are exchanged for fixed rate payments.
  - A currency swap involves a loan in one currency for the loan of another currency for a period of time.
  - An equity swap involves the exchange of the return on an equity index or portfolio for the interest payment on a debt instrument
  - the common pricipals are called the notional principal
  - In a swap contract, two parties agree to pay each other such that the net payment is equivalent to one asset being swapped for another, usually over multiple settlement dates until the expiry
- The contract ends on the expiry date which is usually the date of the last payments to be made
- Each settlement date the difference of period payment is calculated so that only one payment is made

#### Options

- They are Exchange-Traded
- An option contract gives its owner all along the right to buy or sell an asset and a specific exercise price at some specified date in the future
- the long pays, the short a premium to initiate an options contract
- If the long exercises the right, the short who is the writer of the option has the obligation to sell or buy the asset according to the terms of the contract
- on the settlement date, the long the right to buy but not the obligation to buy at a given price for options
  - This price is known as the exercise price or strike price
- To obtain this right an option premium need to be paid, long buys this right from short
- Call option - The long will have the option to buy, short have to sell if long exercises for a specified time period
  - The option Buyer is called the long call, the option seller is called the short call
- Put option - The long will have the option to sell, short have to buy if long exercises for a specified time period
  - The option buyer is called the long put, the option seller is called the short put
- American options may be exercised at any given time up to and including the contracts expiration date,
  - a quick way to remember, `A`(American) stands for `Anytime`
- European options can only be exercised on the contracts expiration date
  - a quick way to remember, `E`(European) stands for `Expiration`
- Contingent claim derivatives can be defined as an option with payoff
  - The payoff here is the profit of the long
  - a event is when the market price of the asset is higher than the exercise price

#### Credit Derivatives

- They are Exchange-Traded
- They are Contingent claim derivatives
  - The payoff here is a payout that compensates the owner in the event of a downgrade or default by a named borrower
- `Credit Default Swap`(CDE)
  - It is a type of credit derivatives
  - an insurance contract against default, a bond holder pays regular premiums to a credit protection seller if the bond issuer defaults the bond holder receives a payout that can compensate for some of the financial loss from the default
- `Credit Spread Option` - the underlying is the credit spread on a bond
  - It is a type of credit derivatives
  - `Credit Spread` is the bonds yield spread relative to a benchmark
  - a bond holder typically pays a premium to buy this call option to be compensated if the bonds credit quality decreases
  - The bond holder chooses the strike level of the option, when a bond is credit quality decreases its yield spread will increase
  - on the expiration of the call option if the yield spread is above the strike the bond holder will collect to pay off based on the difference this pay off compensates the bond holder for the drop in market price of the bond

#### Insurance

- A type of contract
- Pay a premium to the insurer to hedge against the risk of an unfavorable event that may occur in the future before an expiration date. If the event occurs before the contract expiration, you receive a cash payout that compensates you for the financial loss due to the event.

  - Life
  - Liability
  - Automobile insurance
- Some insurance contracts can be traded to other parties
- Credit default swap - A credit default swap makes a payment of an issuer defaults on its bonds. They can be used by bond investors to hedge default risk. They can also be used by parties that will experience losses if the bond defaults
  - Credit default swaps also attract interest from speculators who want to bet on the probability of an issuer defaulting on its bonds

### Pooled Investment Vehicles

- Any of the above investment method can be combined and used as pooled investment vehicles
- The term refers to structures that combine the funds of many investors to build up a portfolio of investments
- The investors ownership interests can be referred to as shares units, depository receipts or limited partnership interests
- It can be mutual funds, exchange traded funds, asset backed securities or hedge funds,

#### Mutual Funds

- Mutual Funds collects money from individual investors and hires a manager to invest in various assets
  - It incur some management fee
  - When the mutual fund are used to track an index, it is called an index mutual funds. It has a lower management fee(MER or Expense Ratio)
- Mutual funds need to be purchased directly from a mutual fund company, a bank, or a broker
- Mutual funds can be open ended or closed ended.
  - Open ended funds issue new shares when an investor buys in and redeem existing shares, when an investor sells, usually on a daily basis
    - price of shares = net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio divided by the total number of shares.
    - Investors generally buy and sell open ended mutual funds by trading with a mutual fund.
  - Closed ended funds issue shares in primary market offerings. Once issued, it can only trade with other investors on the secondary market, usually at a discount

#### ETFs

- ETFs is similar to index mutual funds and it can be exchanged like a stock with a management fee much lower than mutual funds
- When an ETF tracks a forenign market it can be either:
  - Hedged - The price of the fund is only reflected by the tracked security values
    - Extra work is required for the manager to cancel out the fluctation of the currency exchange rate, so it has a higher management fee
  - Unhedge - The price of the fund is reflected by both the tracked security values and currency exchange rate
    - It allows the investor to invest in currency exchange market at the same time, can increase diversity
- Investors trade their shares in the secondary market.
- The market price is actually quite close to the net asset value of the portfolio.
  - Because, ETFs have special provisions allowing some authorized participants (APs) to convert their shares into individual portfolio securities when the price is significantly below NAV or exchange of portfolio shares for ETF shares when the price is significantly above NAV. Such activities help to keep the market price of the ETF close to the NAV per share of the portfolio.
- ETFs are sometimes referred to as depositories, with their shares referred to as depository receipts.

#### Asset Backed Securities

- Securities whose values and income payments are derived from a pool of assets
- Assets include:
  - Mortgages
  - Credit card debt

- Reserved currencies - currencies that national central banks and other monetary authorities hold in significant quantities for international trade
  - Primary reserve currencies are the U.S. dollar and the Euro.
  - Secondary reserve currencies include the British pound, the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc.
- Currencies trade in foreign exchange markets
- In spot currency transactions, one currency is immediately exchanged for another
  - The rate of exchange is called the spot exchange rate.
- Now exchange of currencies does not need to be transacted immediately. Two parties can agree on a fixed rate to exchange out on a date in the future
  - This can be arranged by means of a contract

### Commodities

- Energy products
- Industrial metals,
- Precious metals,
- Agricultural products
- Carbon credits
- Spot commodity markets, trade commodities for immediate delivery, whereas the forward and futures markets trade commodities for future delivery.
- The producers and processors of commodity products are the primary users of the spot commodity markets
  as they are best able to take or make immediate deliveries.
- Many producers employ financial analysts to help them analyze commodity market conditions so that they can best manage their inventories to hedge their operational risks and to speculate on future price changes.
- Many of the producers and consumers of commodities take opposite sides in futures and forward contracts to hedge against change in price in the future.

### Real Assets

- Real assets includes
  - real estate
  - equipment and infrastructure
- Traditionally held by firms for their use in day to day operations

    - diversification benefits
  - Disadvantages of direct investment
    - substantial management costs
    - require substantial due diligence
    - There are also illiquid as the investment size can be large and the pool of investors is limited
  - Indirect investments can buy through vehicles such as real estate investment, trust master, limited partnership or stock of firms that have large ownership of real assets. The investor owns an interest in these vehicles, which hold the assets directly in direct ownership. Interests are typically more liquid than ownership of the assets themselves

## Portfolio Management

- An investment portfolio contains a selection of investments with different weights, in order to control the risks
- Debt securities and equity securites market are negatively correlated(hedged), so investing in a combination of bonds and stocks is popular, and the portfolio can be described as the following allocation models when only considering invest in bonds and stocks:
  - An income portfolio consists primarily of dividend-paying stocks and coupon-yielding bonds where stocks takes from `0%` to `30%`
  - A balanced portfolio invests in both stocks and bonds to reduce potential volatility where stocks takes from `40%` to `60%`
  - A growth portfolio consists of mostly stocks where stocks takes from `70%` to `100%`
- A portfolio needs to be diversified to distribute risks using the following options:
  - select stocks that have different company cap size
  - select stocks that varies in types like growth stock and income stock, and location
  - select stocks from different stock exchange
  - select stocks from different sector

### Financial Reporting Analysis

- Financial Reporting Analysis is a process of forming expectations about the company's ability to earn profits and generate cashflow in the future by examining its financial report, prior to make financial decisions
- Financial reports are published at a regular intervals based on the applicable regulatory requirements
- Footnotes are required for any type of financial reports, it provides additional information about the items presented, for example:
  - Basis of preparation
    - Clarification of the fiscal period covered
    - The inclusion of consolidated entities
    - The accounting methods
    - The significant accounting standards and estimates
    - Assumptions and estimates used
  - Additional material information
    - Business acquisitions or disposals
    - Legal actions
    - Employee benefit plans
    - Contingencies and commitments
    - Significant customers
    - Sales to related parties
    - Segments of the firm
- Managements Discussion and Analysis(MD&A) can also be an addition section
  - It can includes discussion about
    - The nature of the business
    - Past performance
    - Future outlook
    - Effects of inflation and changing prices
    - Off-balance sheet obligations and contractual obligations, such as purchase commitments
    - Accounting policies that require significant management judgment
    - the likely impact of implementing recently issued accounting standards that includes
      - discussion about whether the new standards are applied
      - The material effects on the financial statements or state that they are still evaluating the effects of the new standards
    - Forward-looking expenditures and divestitures
  - In the United States, The FCC requires that the management discuss trends and identify significant events and uncertainties for publicly traded companies
- Framework(Steps) for Financial Statement Analysis:
  1. State the objective and context prior to undertaking an analysis
     - determine what are the questions that the analysis seeks to answer
     - The form in which this information needs to be presented
     - what resources and how much time are available to perform the analysis
  2. Gathers the data required to answer the specific questions
     - acquire the company's financial statements
     - acquire other relevant data on its industry and the economy
     - interview the company's management suppliers and customers and visit companies sites to obtain a qualitative understanding of the company's business competitive stance and future directions
  3. Process the data into meaningful metrics for analysis.
     - Make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements to facilitate comparison against other companies or the industry average
     - Calculate the company ratios and prepare exhibits such as graphs and common size balance sheets
  4. Analyze and interpret the output
     - seeks to answer the questions stated in the first step with the supporting information
     - decides what conclusions or recommendations the information supports
  5. Prepare a report
     - Highlight the conclusions or recommendations with the supporting information
       - report and its dissemination comply with the code and standards that relate to investment analysis and recommendations
         - A critical part of this standard is to distinguish clearly between opinions and facts.
  6. Update the analysis
     - Periodic reviews and updates by repeat the entire process from step 1
- All of the following report can provide useful information for analysis. However, an analyst should also review pertinent information on economic conditions and the company's industry and compare the company to its competitors, this information can be acquired from:
  - Trade Journals
  - Statistical Reporting Services
  - Government Agencies

#### Standards Setting Bodies

- Standards setting bodies are professional not for profit organizations that establish financial reporting standards
- Desirable attributes of standard setting bodies:
  - all parties involved in the standard settings process should observe high professional standards
    - including standards of ethics and confidentiality
  - have adequate authority resources and competencies to fulfill its responsibilities
  - Have clear and consistent standard-setting processes
  - Guided by a well-articulated framework with a clearly stated objective
  - operate independently seeking and considering input from stakeholders but making decisions that are consistent with the stated objective of the framework
  - The decision setting process should not be compromised by pressure from external forces. It should also not be influenced self or special interests.
  - Decisions and resulting standards should be made in the public interest.
- the `International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)` sets Financial Reporting Standards that have been adopted in many countries
  - A standards setting body
  - Widely adopted outside the U.S
  - The `IASB` establishes the `International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)` a standard widely followed by firms outside of the US
  - `IASB` replaced `International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)` in
    - `IASC` issued the `International Accounting Standard (IAS)`. While some rules from `IAS` is still in use, `IASB` replace some of `IAS` by `IFRS`
- `Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)`
  - A standards setting body
  - Widely adopted in the U.S
  - `FASB` establishes the generally accepted accounting principles, known as `US GAAP`

#### Financial Reporting Standards

- Standard setters are working to achieve convergence of financial reporting standards
- To keep up to date on the evolving standards an analyst can monitor professional journals and the `IASB` and `FASB` websites, or position papers on financial reporting issues through the CFA Institute Center for Financial marketing integrity

##### IFRS

- it is a framework is the base of `IASB`'s standards and their requirements for financial statements.
- `IASB` set its standards in the `Conceptual Framework(2010) for Financial Reporting`
  - The framework is designed to assist:
    - standard setters in developing and reviewing standards
    - preparers of financial statements in applying standards and in dealing with issues not specifically covered by standards
    - auditors in forming an opinion on financial statements
    - users in interpreting financial statement information
  - The core of the conceptual framework is the objective to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors, in making decisions about providing resources to the entity includes:
    - the entities financial position
    - financial performance
    - company's cash flow
  - The framework defines usefulness, the information is useful if:
    - it is Relevant - information should have predictive, value confirmatory value or both
      - Materiality is an aspect of relevance.
    - it has been faithfully represented. Such information is complete neutral and free from error.
  - There are four characteristics that enhance relevance and faithful representation
    - compatibility - the financial statement presentation is consistent among firms and across time periods
    - verifiability - independent observers will arrive at similar conclusions if they use the same methods
    - timeliness - the information is available to decision makers before it becomes stale
    - understandability - users should be able to readily understand the information the statements present
  - The framework defines the reporting elements that should be included
    - financial position mearsuring elements
      - assets
        - resources controlled as a result of past transactions.
        - expected to provide future economic benefits
      - liabilities
        - a result of past events
        - expected to require an outflow of economic resources in the future
      - owners equity
        - Equity is the owner's residual interest in the assets After deducting the liabilities
    - performance measuring elements
      - income
        - an increase in economic benefits, either increasing assets or decreasing liabilities in a way that increases owners equity, includes `comprehensive income`, `revenues`, and `gains`
      - expenses
        - decreasing assets or increasing liabilities in a way that decreases owners equity
        - `losses` are to be included in expenses
  - the framework also states that an item should be recognized in the balance sheet or
    income statement if a future economic benefit from the item is probable and the items value or cost can be measured reliably
    - the amounts at which such items are to be reported depend on the measurement base
      - measurement bases include historical cost a motorized cost current cost realizable value present value and fair value
  - the framework states two important underlying assumptions in financial statements
    - accrual accounting - financial statements should reflect transactions at the time they actually occur not necessarily when cash is paid
    - growing concern - assumes the company will continue to exist for the forseeable future
      - If this is not the case then presenting the company's financial position fairly requires a number of adjustments. For example it's inventory or other assets may only be worth their liquidation values
  - The framework defines constraint
    - the cost of providing the information
      - optimally benefits derived from the information should exceed the costs.
      - The aim is to achieve a balance between costs and benefits
    - non quantifiable information like reputation brand loyalty and innovation cannot be captured directly in financial statements
  - The framework does not address the contents of the financial statements
- The `IAS No.1` defines details like which financial statements are required, Their general features and their structure and content, as:
  - Required financial statements
    - balance sheet
    - statement of comprehensive income
      - It can be presented as a single statements or separately as an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income
    - statement of changes in owners equity
    - statement of cash flows
    - notes, summarising accounting policies and disclosing other items
  - General features
    - fair presentation - faithfully representing the effects of the entity's transactions and events
    - going concern basis - the financial statements are based on the assumption that the firm will continue to exist
    - accrual basis - it is used to prepare the financial statements other than the statement of cash flows
    - materiality - the financial statements should be free of misstatements or omissions like good influence the decisions of relevant parties, aggregation of similar items and separation of dissimilar items
    - No offsetting - No offsetting of assets against liabilities or income against expenses unless a specific standard permits or requires it.
    - Frequency of Reporting - frequency must be at least annually
    - comparative information for prior periods should be included unless a specified standard states otherwise
    - consistency - between periods in how items are presented and classified with prior period amounts disclosed for comparison
  - Structure and Content
    - classified balance sheet showing current and non-current assets and liabilities
    - Minimum information is required on the face of each financial statement
      - For example the face of the balance sheet must show specific items such as cash and cash equivalents, plant property and equipment and inventories
    - Minimum specified no disclosures - The standard specifies disclosures about information to be presented in the footnotes
    - This information must be provided in a systematic manner and cross referenced from the face of the financial statements
    - Comparative information for prior period should be included unless a specified standard states otherwise

##### US GAAP

- Many aspects of `IFRS` and `US GAAP` have converged over the past decade
- Compare to `IFRS`, `US GAAP` has the following difference:
  - only revenue and expenses are listed as elements related to performance
  - `US GAAP` defines an asset as a resource for which a future economic benefit is expected to flow.
    - The `FASB` defines it simply as a future economic benefit(probable)
  - `US GAAP` allow the upward valuation of most assets, but `FASB` doesn't
  - still disagree on the best treatment of certain items or issues
    - certain business groups place pressures to block any changes in accounting practices that may not be in their best interest
- In many cases however a company will present a reconciliation statement showing what its financial results would have been under an alternative reporting system

#### Regulatory Authorities

- Regulatory Authorities are governmental entities that have the legal authority to enforce financial reporting requirements
  - `U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)` enforce the standards in the U.S.
    - The `SEC` no longer requires `IFRS` reporting firms to reconcile their financial statements to `US GAAP`
    - It requires the listed companies to file standardized forms regularly.
      - form `S-1` a registration statement filed prior to the sale of new securities to the public
      - Form `10-K` which is a required annual filing similar to that which a firm typically provides in its annual report to shareholders
        - The forms `40-F` and `20-F` are the equivalent `10-K` for Canadian and other foregin issuer respectively
      - Form `10-Q` which U.S. firms are required to file quarterly with updated financial statements which need not be audited
        - Non-US companies are typically required to file the equivalent forms `6-K` semiannually
      - form `DEF-14A` is to be filed when a company prepares a proxy statement for its shareholders prior to the annual meeting or other shareholder vote
      - form `8-K` is to be filed to disclose material events like significant asset acquisition or disposal and changes in management
      - form `144` is a notification to the `SEC` when a company issues securities to certain qualified buyers
      - form `3,4,5` include the beneficial ownership of securities by a companie's offices and directors
  - `European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA)` - a European Union financial regulatory agency and European Supervisory Authority, located in Paris
- The `SEC` and `ESMA` are members of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (`OICV-IOSCO`)
  - `OICV-IOSCO` is not a regulatory authority but its members regulate a significant portion of the world's financial capital markets
  - has a goal of uniform financial regulations across countries
- According to IFCO the three objectives of financial market regulation are:
  - Protect investors
  - Ensure the fairness efficiency and transparency of markets
  - Reduce systematic risk

##### International Financial Reporting Standards

#### Balance Sheet

- a snapshot of the firm's financial position
- It has three components:
  - Assets - resources owned by the company(e.g. Equipment, Cash)
  - Liability - amount borrowed from others
  - Owner's Equity - it equals `Assets - Liability`

#### Income Statement

- It accounts the net income of a company for a certain period
- `Net Income = Revenue - Expenses + Other Income`
  - `Revenue` - inflows from delivering or producing goods and services and other activities
  - `Expenses` - outflows in the processes of running operations that generates revenue including depreciation of assets and concurrence of liabilities
  - `Other Income` - inflows that is not from the ordinary course of the business

#### Comprehensive Income Statement

- It accounts the gains and losses that are excluded from the income statement, e.g.
  - Unrealized gains on losses on investments that are classified as available for
    sale
  - Foreign currency translation gains or losses
  - Pension plan gains or losses
- Optionally, comprehensive income statement can combine with net income statement as a `Total Comprehensive Income Statement`

#### Changes in Equity

- `Net Changes in Equity` is the amount of the changes in Owner's Equity between two balance sheet from one period to its next
- `Net Changes in Equity = Total Comprehensive Income - Changes in Equity`
- It explains the changes in equity
  - e.g. the shareholder transactions like dividend payout

#### Statement of Cashflows

- A disclosure of the sources and uses of cash, and the net cashflow should matches the changes in balance cash on the balance sheet from one period to the next, it evaluates company's liquidity
- Net cashflows are consisted of three sections:
  - Operation Cashflows - activities cashs related to the transactions occurred during normal business
  - Investments Cashflows - activities related to the purchase and sell of long-term assets
  - Financing Cashflows - activities related to obtaining or repaying captial

#### Auditor's Reports

- an audit is an independent review of a firms financial statements
  - The objective of an audit is to enable the auditor to provide an opinion on the fairness and reliability of the financial statements
  - The auditor examines the company's accounting and internal control systems confirms assets and liabilities and determines that there are no material errors in the financial statements.
- An audit will be completed by an independent certified public accountant, appointed by the board of directors
- The standard auditor's opinion contains three key elements:
  - They are the financial statements are prepared by the management and are its responsibility
  - Generally accepted auditing standards were followed, thus providing reasonable assurance that the financial statements contained no material errors
  - An opinion will be given from the audit on whether the statements were prepared in accordance with accepted accounting principles, the opinion can be
    - `Unqualified Opinion` - If the statements are free from material omissions and errors
    - `Qualified Opinion` - If the statements make exceptions to the accounting principles
    - `Adverse Opinion` - If the statements are materially nonconforming with accouting standards
    - `Disclaimer of Opinion` - If the auditor is unable to express an opinion
    - Opinion on the `Internal Control System` is requied in the US
      - `Internal Control System` - It's the processes by which the company ensures that it presents accurate financial statements
      - The managements of US public companies are deemed responsible for the effectiveness of internal control for the company, they should:
        - Evaluate the effectiveness of the internal controls
        - Provide a report on internal control

#### Other Reports

##### Interim Reports

- It provides updated information on the company's performance and financial position since the last annual report
- It is published either semi-annually or quarterly depending on the applicable regulatory requirements
- Interim reports generally present the basic financial statements and condense notes but are not audited

##### Proxy Statements

- They are issued to shareholders when there are matters that require a shareholder vote
- These statements are a good source of information about the election of board members, compensation, management qualifications, and the issuance of stock options

##### Corporate Reports & Press Releases

- They are released by management and are often viewed as public relations or sales materials
- Not all of the material is independently reviewed by outside auditors

##### Earnings Guidance

- They are published slightly ahead of the actual release of the financial statements
- They are usually less useful than other reports

### Technical Analysis

- It is a combination of art and science, of forecasting the future price movement, that is based on an examination of the past price movements
- It works for all tradable instrucments which have prices fluctuated overtime
- Technical Analysis only focuses on the actual price movement, any consideration other than the price movement like financial reports and news are part of the fundamental analysis
- It is a type of quantitaive analysis, a part of fundamental analysis that doesn't rely on numbers are qualitative analysis
- The Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis
  - The market discounts everything - The final price of an aset on the market has taken everything into consideration including market psychology(Efficient Markets Hypothesis)
  - Price moves in trends - A price trend can always be identifid in a efficient and transparent market
  - History tends to repeat itself - the standing point of chart patterns analysis
- Types of charts
  - Line charts - it plots the closing price over time
    - A local maxima is called a peak, a local minima is called a trough
  - Bar charts - it plots a bar for the price action of each day, the highest daily price is at top of the bar and lowest daily price at the bottom of the bar, the bar is also colored in green and red to show the overall rise and fall
    - Daily bar charts - it indicates the opening price on the left on the bar and closing price on the right
  - Candlesticks charts - it plots bars which demostrate prices bounded by the opening and closing prices and use extended lines(called shadows) to show the highest and lowest prices for a selected time frame
    - time frame can be any time intervals based on the platform software
    - Doji candles are candles that describe the same open and closing prices
    - When it has no upper and lower shadow it is called Marubozu candles
  - Heikin Ashi charts - similar to Candlesticks but it uses the midpoint of the previous candle body as open value and use the average of open-high-low-close (OHLC) of the current period as close value
    - It is the refined version of Candlesticks charts that filters out noises
- There are different types of trading each with different focuses on the time frame:
  - Intraday Trading - Hold trades for few minutes to few hours but not overnight
    - Scalping - Hold trades for only few seconds or few minutes
  - Positional Trading - Holds trades overnight from a few days to few months
    - Intermediate - Hold trades for few weeks to few months but less than one year
    - Short Term(Swing Trading) - Hold trades for few days to few weeks
  - Long Term investment(Long-term Positional Trading) - Hold trades for more than one year
- Online analysis platform like [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com) is a popular choice for technical analysis

#### Trend Analysis

- The trend of the price shows the relationship of demand of supply, the trend only changes when an external force is applied
- Trend can be:
  - Uptrend - the overall price has higher highs, and higher lows
  - Downtrend - the overal price has lower lows, and lower highs
  - Sideways trend - a horizontal trend during the transition period between uptrends and downtrends
- The prices alway fluctuate within a trend, short term trading can take advantages of this property
- A trend that last for 5 to 20 years is called a secular trend
- Trends can be categorized by time frame
  - Major trend - long-term trend
  - Intermediate trend - 1 to 3 months trend within the major trend
  - Minor trend - trend within one month with the intermediate trend
- Stages are determined by the transation of trends
  - Stage 1 - The sideways trend after a downtrend
    - it is a consolidation phase that can be called a accumulation phase when price increases slowly
  - Stage 2 - The uptrend after stage 1
  - Excess Phase - sometimes exists in between stage 2 and stage 3, this price suddenly rises and it is a sign of stage 3
    - Exhaustion Phase always follows the excess phase, is a sudden price drop after the excess phase
    - Excess Phase and Exhaustion Phase together, are sometimes recognized as two main parts of a stage 3
  - Stage 3 - The sideways trend after an uptrend
    - It's a consolidation phase that can be a accumulation phase if price goes up or distribution phase if price goes down
  - Stage 4 - The downtrend after stage 3
- Trendline is one of the most important tools in technical analysis
  - Join all troughs will create the trend line for an uptrend(also known as support), and join the peaks for a downtrend(also known as resistance)
    - Support or resistance are dynamic for uptrend and downtrend, when it is horizontal(sideways trendlines) it is a static support or resistance
    - Sometimes resistance can changed to a support level when price goes up, or vice versa
    - the faster the prices change the more likely the prices will break the trendlines
    - Volumn spikes drive the price to break the trendlines
  - When the price is crossing the trendline, a trend is changing
    - it can change back to the same trend but with a different slope
  - Main Trand line with longer time frame can be intersected by an internal trendline with a shorter time frame
  - It is better to use logrithmic scale for the y-asix to draw the trend line
    - the space between larger numbers are smaller
  - The points used to draw trendlines should be evenly spaced
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a hanging man pattern which is a red bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
  - The local minima can be indicated by a hammer man pattern which is a green bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the dragonfly candle
  - The local maxima can be indicated by a shooting star pattern which is a red bar with long upper shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small lower shadow in the candlesticks chart, it ususlly follows a green bar
    - When it is a doji candle, it is called the gravestone candle
  - Marubozu shows confidence in growth when green and decrease when red
- Fibonacci retracement

#### Indicators

- They can be categorized as:
  - lagging indicator - it is a financial sign that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place. Therefore, lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them
  - leading indicator - it corresponds with a future movement or change in some phenomenon of interest. It helps to predict and forecast future events and trends
  - oscillator - a line graph that moves between two extremes

##### Lagging Indicator

- Moving Average - indicates changes in trend
  - It calculates and, for each day, it plots the average of all previous prices in a given time frame over the price chart
  - Exponentional moving average(EMA) is preferred, it reacts quicker to small price changes
  - Simple moving average is suitable for big time frames
  - 200 days moving average is popular
    - Bull lives above(current prices are higher than average price) the a average chart, Bear lives below(current prices are lower than average price) the a average chart
    - It can also act as a support and resistent level
  - It only provides valuable information when martket is in trend
  - The intersections between moving average charts for various length of time frame can be used to indicate turning points
  - Different trading types use different period:
    - Long Term Investor - uses 200, 100, 50 periods
    - Positional Trader - uses 50, 21, 14 periods
    - Intraday Trader - uses 14, 7, 3 periods
- Moving Average Convergence/Divergence(MACD) - indicates changes in trend
  - It is also recognized as a momentum oscillator
  - It shows the postive or negative difference between a "fast" (short period) EMA, and a "slow" (longer period) EMA, in a bar chart
  - When the difference is positive the price goes up, otherwise, the price goes down

##### Oscillator

- The relative strength index (RSI) - It is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset
  - It can have a reading from 0 to 100, high RSI value(above 70) represents overbought,low RSI value(below 30) represents oversold
  - when above 50, it is an uptrend, when below 50, it is a downtrend
- The A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time
  - It is consisted of K line and D line ranging from 0 to 100
  - When K line cross above D line around 20, it is a buy signal
  - When K line cross below D line around 80, it is a sell signal
  - Whenever two lines falls below 20, it a signal of oversold. When two lines goes above 80, it is a signal of overbought
  - Sharpe bottom and broad top represents an uptrend and vice versa
  - Short-term market players tend to choose low settings for all variables, and vice versa

##### Fibanacci Retracement

- It is used to predict support level in a clear uptrend or downtrend
- The ratio of the adjecent number in a fibonacci series will approach to the golden ratio(`1.618`)
- The ratio used in the Fibanacci retracement tools are:
  - `0`
  - `0.236`, which is from `0.618-0.382`
  - `0.328`, which is from `1 - 0.618` or `0.618 * 0.618`
  - `0.5`, one half
  - `0.618`, which is the inverse of a golden ratio `1/1.618`, it is called the golden mean `0.618`
  - `0.786`, which is the square root of `0.618`
  - `0.88`
  - `1`
  - Extension Level 1 - `1.272`, which is the square root of `1.618`
  - Extension Level 2 - `2.618`, which is from `1.618 * 1.618`
  - Extension Level 3 - `4.236`, which is from `2.618 * 1.618`
- The ratio should be drawn between the peak and trough(a swing) from `1` to `0`
  - `1` should be at the trough for an uptrend
  - `1` should be at the peak for an downtrend
  - Usually, draw from left to right when using analysis platform softwares
- After drawing the scale, each ratio level can be treated as potential support level, since buyers tend to trade when those level are reached
- Draw the scale in a reverse order(from right to left) to use the extension levels, extension levels indicates the target prices(the next peak in an uptrend or the next trough in a downtrend)
- It is suggest to apply the scale on the current swing(the lastest known swing), and analysis on higher timeframe
  - When new swing forms draw the new scale on the new swing

### Risks

- All investment associates with some risks
- Generally higher risks yields more profit
- Risk Types:
  - Market Risk(systematic risk from the overall market)
  - Business Risk(Bankruptcy of a certain company)
  - Credit Risk(a company can't loan more money)
  - Taxability Risk(Higher taxes for a certain sector)
  - Interest Rate Risk(Bonds interest rate changes)
  - Inflationary Risk(The price of certain services and goods changes faster than others)
  - Liquidity Risk(A company has no cash flow)
  - Social, Political, and Regulatory Risk
  - Currency and Exchange Rate Risk(Import/Export companies)
  - Mutual Fund Manager Risk(Manager decision varies)
- Risk tolerance is the degree of variability in investment returns that an investor is willing to withstand in their financial planning
- An Investment Time Horizon, or Time Horizon, is the period of time one expects to hold an investment until they need the money back
- For people with high risk tolerance, the time horizon need to be longer
- Comparing risks among each types of securities, `Equity > Debt`
- Investing in stocks from small cap companies is more risker
