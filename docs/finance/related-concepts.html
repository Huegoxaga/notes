<h2 id="time-value-of-money">Time Value of Money</h2>
<ul>
<li>The time value of money (TVM) is the concept that money you have now is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity, the time value can be:<ul>
<li>Present value(PV) is the current value before making the investment</li>
<li>Future value(FV) is the future value after making the investment</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The interest rate is the amount charged, expressed as a percentage of the principal, by a lender to a borrower for the use of assets, it is consisted of the following components:<ul>
<li>Risk Premium Components - this part compensate the risk for lending, it includes:<ul>
<li>Default Risk Premium - it reflects the borrower&apos;s financial status</li>
<li>Liquidity Premium - it reflects the demand of the debt covenants(which is the debt agreement or financial contracts for loans and bonds) in the market, or the cost of selling it</li>
<li>Maturity Risk Premium - the longer the term, the higher the risk. The lender needs more courage to lend out for a longer period</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Risk-free Components(Nominal Risk-free Rate) - this part compensate the losses of the lender for not having the money on hand, it equals the minimum returns if the lender use the money to make any investment elsewhere. In the U.S, the interest rate of Treasury Bill (T-Bill, a short-term U.S. government debt ) is used as a benchmark for this component, it includes:<ul>
<li>Inflation Premium - it guarantees the purchasing power of the money after the borrower returns the money, it matches the expect inflation rate</li>
<li>Real Risk-free Rate - this is the incentives for the lender to lend the money</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The interest rate can be called differently based on different interpretation<ul>
<li>The <code>Required Rate of Return</code> for the lenders or investors</li>
<li>The interest rate can be seen as a <code>Discounted Rate</code> by discounting the future value of the total return</li>
<li>It can be treated as the <code>Opportunity Cost</code> of the current consumption of the money if not lending it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the time period of an interest rate is not spcified, it is an annual interest rate</li>
<li>A cashflow means a certain amount of money, usually used for making investment, it can be:<ul>
<li>A single cashflow - a lump sum of money</li>
<li>Regular cashflows - continous contribution, same amount every time</li>
<li>Uneven cashflows - continous contribution, uneven amount every time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simple interest only uses the original pricipal to calculate interest for the next time period</li>
<li>Compound interest will include the interest earned from previous time period to calculate the interest for the next time period<ul>
<li><code>FV=PV(1+r)^N</code> where <code>r</code> is the interest occurs during the time period and <code>N</code> is the total number of time periods</li>
<li>If interest <code>r</code> for a certain time period is divided from annual interest <code>R</code> by <code>n</code>, if there are <code>n</code> time periods each year</li>
<li>The more frequent the rate of compounding the higher the interest the investor can get</li>
<li>The Effective Annual Rate(EAR) is the total annual interest rate after compounding, <code>EAR=((1+r)^N)-1</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Continuous compound has the compound frequency set to infinite<ul>
<li>Then, <code>FV = PV*e^(rN)</code> and <code>EAR=e^r-1</code> where <code>r</code> is the stated compound rate and <code>N</code> is the stated number of time period for the stated rate</li>
<li>Continuous compound yields the highest interest one can get from compounding, given the same interest rate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time values of regular cashflows can be calculatd by stacking each individual single cashflow with different number of time period together, the calculation can be simplified using the formula for the sum of a geometric series<ul>
<li>regular cashflows calculation can have a end mode(default for most calculators) which means the cashflow is added at the end of each time period</li>
<li>regular cashflows calculation can have a begin mode which means the cashflow is added at the beginning of each time period</li>
<li>Begin mode will compound the interest one more time at the end</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For uneven casflows calculation each cashflow separate then add them together</li>
<li>Annuity - An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which you make a lump-sum payment or series of payments and, in return, receive regular cashflows, beginning either immediately or at some point in the future. it can be further categorized as:<ul>
<li>Annuity Due - regular cashflows, begin mode</li>
<li>Ordinary Annuities - regular cashflows, end mode</li>
<li>Perpetuities - regular cashflows, end mode, infinite number of time periods<ul>
<li>The time value for perpetuities equals payment amount divided by the interest rate for the payment time period</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When calculating cashflow it&apos;s critical to determine the entity(e.g. bank or investor) and the outflows and inflows of the cashflows for this entity, use negative sign for outflows and positive sign for inflows</li>
<li>Discounted Cashflow is a method to discount all cashflows from its future value to its present value by compounded the discounted rate(interest rate)<ul>
<li>Net Present Value(NPV) is the sum of the discounted present value for all inflows and outflows</li>
<li>The discounted rate used to make the NPV equals zero is called the Internal Rate of Return(IRR)</li>
<li>A investment will generates profit if the NPV is positive, the higher the NPV the more profit a investor can gain from it</li>
<li>IRR is a reference for the rate of return, it can be used to see it the rate of return is desirable</li>
<li>The Money Weighed Rate of Return(MWRR) of a investment portfolio is used to see the return rate of this investment, the calculation is the same as calculating <code>IRR</code></li>
<li>The Holding Period Return(HPR) is a way to evaluate the performance of a portfolio for each holding period(time period), <code>HPR = EndValue+Cashflows/BeginValue - 1</code><ul>
<li>Begin Values - The balance of the investment account at the beginning of a certain time period</li>
<li>End Values - The balance of the investment account at the end of a certain time period including any payouts</li>
<li>Cashflows - any payouts from the bank</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Time Weighted Rate of Return(TWRR) is the preferred way to evaluate the investment performance, calculated by adding all HPR values by 1(change factor) and find <code>Nth</code> root of their product where <code>N</code> is the number of HPR values or time period, lastly substruct the final result by <code>1</code><ul>
<li>It is the geometric mean of the change factors of all HPR values</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For all of the above calculation for return, a nagative HPR means losses, and a positive HPR means gains</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="statistics-concepts">Statistics Concepts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Types of scales for statistic meaturement<ul>
<li>Nominal Scale - A property of the data is categorized by name</li>
<li>Ordinal Scale - A property of the data is categorized by rank</li>
<li>Interval Scale - Data is placed on to a uniformed scale without a true zero on the scale<ul>
<li>a true zero represent the absent of a measurable property</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ratio Scale - Data is placed on to a uniformed scale with a true zero on the scale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statistics Terminology<ul>
<li><code>Observation</code> - Each data entry</li>
<li><code>Population</code> - Set of all observation</li>
<li><code>Sample</code> - Subset of the population</li>
<li><code>Parameter</code> - Measure used to describe a characteristic of a population, e.g. <code>std. dev.</code></li>
<li><code>Descriptive Statistics</code> - consolidating a mass of data into useful information</li>
<li><code>Inferential Statistics</code> - making estimates about a population from a sample, when the entire population is not available to measure or too big to get<ul>
<li><code>Sample Statistic</code> - a piece of information one can get from a fraction of a population</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Statistical Analysis Tools<ul>
<li><code>Frequency Distribution</code>(Histogram) - represents the likelyhood of a data to fall into a certain range<ul>
<li>Steps to draw a frequency distribution:<ol>
<li>Set the interval by dividing the differece of the max and min into a suitable(from 5 to 10) number of section<ul>
<li>Use whole numbers for interval boundaries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Count the number of observation for each interval, and draw the count as bar graph</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><code>Frequency Polygon</code> - connects the top midpoint of the histogram&apos;s bar</li>
<li><code>Absolute Frequency Distribution</code> - the y-axis is the data count</li>
<li><code>Relative Frequency Distribution</code> - the y-axis is the <code>data count / total data count</code></li>
<li><code>Accumulative Frequency Distribution</code> - Suming the y value from left to right along the x-axis<ul>
<li>the right most bar has <code>100%</code></li>

<h2 id="economics">Economics</h2>
<h3 id="demand-and-supply-analysis">Demand and Supply Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="demand-analysis">Demand Analysis</h4>
<ul>
<li>Demand Curve has quantity demanded on the x-axis and the price of the item on the y-axis<ul>
<li>Quantity demanded represents the comsumer&apos;s intention to buy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The demand function - quantity demanded equals a constant plus the Own-Price coefficient times Own-Price value plus Cross-price elasticity coeffiecient times Cross-price value plus income coeffiecient times income value<ul>
<li>The quantity demanded is associated with a period, e.g. the demand for 15 apples in a month</li>
<li>The quantity demanded is associated wiath a specific group of consumers (e.g. low-income)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For all the following elasticity, when the absolute value is above 1, it is elastic. When it is less than 1, it is in elastic<ul>
<li>A high elasticity will greatly effect the demand</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The law of demand - conditional on all else being equal, as the price of a good increases, quantity demanded will decrease; conversely, as the price of a good decreases, quantity demanded will increase</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="own-price-elasticity-of-demand">Own-Price Elasticity of Demand</h5>
<ul>
<li>Own-Price Elasticity of Demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded when the price changes by 1 percent<ul>
<li>it is not equal to the slope of a demand curve</li>
<li>it depends on the current price or demand and it is not constant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Own-price coefficient multiple by the current own-price value and divided by the total quantity demand will get the Own-price elasticity<ul>
<li>The reciprocal of the elasticity coefficient is the slope of the demand curve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the Demand Curve is downward sloping the Own-Price Elasticity is negative, and the law of demand applies<ul>
<li>There is a region in the demand curve that the quantity demanded is very responsive to a change in price in terms of the changes in percentage, the demand is elastic,<ul>
<li>the absolute value of elasticity is greater than 1</li>
<li>When the demand curve is fully horizontal, it is called perfectly elastic demand where the elasticity is infinite</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is a region in the demand curve that the quantity demanded is not very responsive to a change in price in terms of the changes in percentage, the demand is inelastic<ul>
<li>The absolute value of elasticity is less than 1</li>
<li>When the demand curve is fully vertical. it is called perfectly inelastic demand where the elasticity is equal to zero</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There&apos;s this unique point where the elasticity is minus 1, it is called the unitary elasticity point<ul>
<li>the total revenue is maximized at this point</li>
<li>it&apos;s the dividing point between the elastic region and inelastic region of the demand curve<ul>
<li>an increase in price moves us to the elastic region of the curve</li>
<li>a decrease in price from this point moves us into the inelastic region</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Factors that effects the slope of the demand and price<ul>
<li>when goods have many other close substitutes, it will be elastic</li>
<li>If the the price of the goods is more expensive compared to the comsumer&apos;s income it will be more elastic</li>
<li>The elasticity of demand tends to be greater in the long run, as consumers can take time to make adjustments to their consumption habits</li>
<li>Essential goods tend to be more inelastic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cross-price-elasticity-of-demand">Cross-price Elasticity of Demand</h5>
<ul>
<li>the percentage change in quantity demanded for every percentage change in price of the related good</li>
<li>the cross price elasticity is positive when the related good is a substitute</li>
<li>the cross price elasticity is negative when the related good is a compliment</li>
<li>Cross-price coefficient multiple by the cross-price value and divided by the total quantity demand will return the cross-price elasticity</li>
<li>When the price of a goods drops while all its substitutes&apos; price keep the same, the demand for that goods will increase this is called a positive substitute effect</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="income-elasticity-of-demand">Income Elasticity of Demand</h5>
<ul>
<li>the percentage change in quantity, demanded for every percentage change in income level</li>
<li>Normal goods are those in which the demand increases with consumer income levels and vice versa, the income elasticity is therefore positive for normal goods</li>
<li>Inferior goods(goods that save budget) are those for which the demand decreases with consumer income levels, the income elasticity is therefore negative for inferior goods.</li>
<li>Income coefficient multiple by the income value and divided by the total quantity demand will return the income elasticity</li>
<li>When there is a positive change in real income (purchasing power) due to prices drop on some goods, the demand for normal goods will increase and it is called a positive income effect, inferior goods will result in a negative income effect</li>
<li>For an inferior good, when the negative income effect outweights the positive substitute effect, it is called a Giffen good, the demand curve of this good will be an upward sloping straight line<ul>
<li>It is a exception to the law of demand</li>
<li>only in theory, there are some rare instances where this has turned out to be true</li>
<li>another exception where the demand curve is upward sloping is the Veblen good for which a higher price makes the goods more desirable. This is usually the case for some luxury goods like Hermes bags where the higher price conveys higher status to the owners. It only applies to a select group of people who can afford it and there has to be a limit to it</li>

<h5 id="the-law-of-diminishing-marginal-returns">The Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns</h5>
<ul>
<li>In order to supply goods the factors of production are required<ul>
<li>Land - the physical space you own or rent</li>
<li>Labour (L) - all workers from unskilled to top management</li>
<li>Capital (K) sometimes called plant and equipment<ul>
<li>this does not include financial capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Materials - refers to the inputs that make the production possible</li>
<li>Economists typically concentrate on just two of these, labor (L) and physical capital (K)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The total product function<ul>
<li>In a short run, some factors of production are fixed, like capital. The total production should be a function of the labor</li>
<li>In the long run however all factors of production are variable. The total production should be a function of the labor and capital input</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Total production is simply the total output in a period</li>
<li>Average production is the total output per unit of input</li>
<li>Marginal product is the amount of additional product resulting from using one more unit of input</li>
<li>The diminishing marginal productivity of labor where in the short run the additional output from each additional worker decreases progressively, it happens in three stages<ul>
<li>when the labor input is smaller marginal productivity is increasing the slope of the output curve increases at this stage</li>
<li>when the labor input gets larger. The marginal productivity is decreasing the slope of the output curve decreases at this stage</li>
<li>and for some companies marginal productivity can become zero or even negative, the output curve hits a maximum and starts to dip beyond that</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="breakeven-and-shutdown-analysis">Breakeven and Shutdown Analysis</h5>
<ul>
<li>Fixed costs cannot be changed in the short run, e.g. rental lease<ul>
<li>average fixed cost (AFC) - total fixed cost devided by the number of output<ul>
<li>when plot the average fixed cost against the quantity produced, it will show a downward sloping line</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Variable costs vary according to the level of production, e.g. labour cost<ul>
<li>average variable cost (AVC) - total variable cost devided by the number of output<ul>
<li>because of diminishing marginal productivity of labor. The average variable cost starts increasing after a certain point</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Total cost equals fixed cost plus variable costs<ul>
<li>average total cost (ATC) - total cost divide by the number of output<ul>
<li>The ATC graph looks similar to the AVC, shift up by the AFC</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marginal cost is the change in total cost per unit change in output quantity<ul>
<li>it is upward sloping after a certain point due to diminishing marginal productivity</li>
<li>marginal cost curve has the actual cost of that additional output on the y-axis</li>
<li>marginal cost curve intersects the AVC and ATC curves at their minimum</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Revenue - price times the quantity sold</li>
<li>The average profit per cup is the difference between the marginal cost and average total cost</li>
<li>The profit maximizing point will then be the point where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost, because it is the highest point where <code>MR &gt; MC</code> is satisfied</li>
<li>This minimum point where the <code>ATC</code> is equal to the <code>MC</code> is the breakeven level, when price goes above this level the business makes a profit, when price goes below this level the business will have a loss</li>
<li>When the price is below the breakeven level and falls in between the lowest point of <code>ATC</code> and <code>AVC</code> cost, the profit maximizing point is also in between the <code>ATC</code> and <code>AVC</code> cost, the firm will be running at loss but it still has revenue to cover the <code>AVC</code> and part of the <code>AFC</code><ul>
<li>In this case, continue running the business in short run can minimize loss of the fixed cost, since there is no refund for fixed costs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This minimum point where the <code>AVC</code> is equal to the <code>MC</code> is the shutdown level, When price goes below the <code>AVC</code> cost, the <code>AVC</code> cannot be covered and there is no point to keep the business in both short and long run</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="economies-and-diseconomies-of-scale">Economies and Diseconomies of Scale</h5>
<ul>
<li>In a long run the <code>AVC</code> for short run can shift to the right because the output product quantity is increased due the increase in productivity after business growed by investing</li>
<li>The <code>AVC</code> curve might even shift to a lower position due to the the effect called the <code>Economies of Scale</code>, Economies of scale occur if the cost per unit of production falls as the firm increases its scale, it results from factors such as:<ul>
<li>labour specialization</li>
<li>mass production</li>
<li>investment in more efficient equipment and technology</li>
<li>being able to lower input prices with suppliers as its bargaining power increases with scale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Economies of Scale</code> have to hit a limit somewhere. When scaling up does not result in any economies of scale. It is called the <code>Constant Returns to Scale</code></li>
<li><code>Diseconomies of Scale</code> happens when scaling up even further results in an increase in average cost, due to:<ul>
<li>inefficiencies from bureaucracy of larger firms</li>
<li>problems with motivating a larger workforce</li>
<li>greater barriers to innovation and entrepreneurial activity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if we draw a line that connects all the minimums of the short run <code>ATC</code> (<code>SR ATC</code>) curves we get the long run <code>ATC</code> curve (<code>LR ATC</code>) of the firm<ul>
<li><code>Minimum Efficient Scale</code> - the lowest point on the <code>LR ATC</code> corresponds to the scale at which the average total cost of production is minimized</li>

<h4 id="perfect-competition">Perfect Competition</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is where many firms produce identical products. And competition forces them all to sell at the market price</li>
<li>This is just in theory, some industry like wheat production industry are close to it, its price depends on the overall market supply and demand</li>
<li>A perfectly competitive market has a perfectly elastic demand curve. The marginal revenue is equal to the average revenue which is equal to the market price<ul>
<li>A perfectly elastic demand curve, will have the price as a constant, regardless the quantity demanded</li>
<li>Under perfect competition firms must operate at minimum efficient scale in the long run, all compititos operate their at this scale in the long run. So this minimum will equal the market price which is the marginal revenue and also the average revenue, anyone operating at a different scale will have a cost that is higher than the market price and have a loss</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="monopolistic-competition">Monopolistic Competition</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is where there are many sellers and differentiated products</li>
<li>It has a downward sloping elastic demand curve</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="oligopoly">Oligopoly</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is where a few firms compete in a variety of ways</li>
<li>Firms need to consider other firms&apos;(interdependent firms) strategy</li>
<li>Demand is also downward sloping but can vary in elasticity, in general firms (Automobile Industry) that are very differentiated from itself to others tend to have more elastic demand than firms with less differentiation (Telco industry)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="monopoly">Monopoly</h4>
<ul>
<li>It is where only one firm is producing the product</li>
<li>It has a downward sloping demand curve which is the market demand curve, and firm has the power to choose the price at which it sells its product</li>
<li>there can be a few reasons for monopolies:<ul>
<li>Firstly very high barriers to entry protect a monopoly producer from competition</li>
<li>copyrights and patents also protect a monopoly from competition</li>
<li>sometimes firm has control over a resource specifically needed to produce the product</li>
<li>Mostly monopoly power is supported by government in such cases the price the monopoly charges is often regulated by the government as well</li>
</ul>
