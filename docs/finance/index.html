<ul>
<li>Finance, as a discipline, derived from ecomonics; it involves assessing money, banking, credit, investments, and other aspects of the financial systems</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="functions-of-the-financial-system">Functions of the Financial System</h3>
<ol>
<li>Help its participants achieve their purposes in using the financial system<ul>
<li>The participants in the financial system are primarily individuals, firms and governments</li>
<li>Purposes of the participants in using the financial system are:<ul>
<li>Save<ul>
<li>Individuals typically save for retirement and expect a return that compensates them for risk and the use of their money</li>
<li>Firm save a portion of their sales to fund future expenditures, instruments used for saving include stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit or real assets such as real estate</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Borrow<ul>
<li>Individuals often borrow in order to buy a house, fund a college education or for other purposes</li>
<li>Governments may borrow by issuing debt to fund their expenditures</li>
<li>Firms may borrow in order to finance capital expenditures and for other activities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issue equity<ul>
<li>Firms can raise capital by issuing equity where the capital providers become shareholders of the company and will share in any future profits</li>
<li>The financial system facilitates raising equity capital through<ul>
<li>investment banks which help with issuance</li>
<li>analysts value the equity</li>
<li>reporting requirements and accounting standards, ensure the production of meaningful financial disclosures</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Manage risks<ul>
<li>Changing interest rates</li>
<li>Currency values</li>
<li>Commodity values</li>
<li>Defaults on debt</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exchange assets<ul>
<li>The above risks can often be managed by trading contracts that serve as hedges for the risks.</li>
<li>Difference from spot market trading is more common and convenient to trade in an organized market governed by the financial system<ul>
<li>spot market trading - trade directly with one another</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Utilize information<ul>
<li>Not all market participants, however, have an operational need to trade in the financial market</li>
<li>Some people trade based on information that they believe allows them to predict future prices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Determine the rates of return<ul>
<li>the rates should equate the total supply of savings with the total demand for borrowing</li>
<li>Borrowing and lending can be viewed as demand and supply of money in the financial system.</li>
<li>The demand and supply are highly affected by the rate of return or interest rates</li>
<li>equilibrium interest rate - the rate at which the amount the borrowers desire is equal to the amount that the lenders desire</li>
<li>In many countries, the central bank plays an important role in guiding this equilibrium rate through monetary policy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>allocate capital to its most efficient uses<ul>
<li>As capital is limited, the financial system should be structured such that funds are allocated to uses that are most productive</li>
<li>In market based economies, lenders determine directly or indirectly which borrower obtains capital.Borrowers who have better credit ratings are perceived as being less risky. So lenders with a lower risk appetite will be fine with lending, even though the rate of return is lower.<ul>
<li>This process is efficient only if market information is accurate.</li>
<li>The regulators and standard setting bodies have the responsibility to ensure that financial information is accurately reported in the most useful manner</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="best-condition-for-the-financial-system">Best Condition for the Financial System</h4>

<li>Stocks can be sold publically on stock exchange<ul>
<li>An IPO(Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a firm places shares on the public market for the first time</li>
<li>A company will hire an underwriter(mostly investment bank) who will help the company to sell the IPO portion of its shares publically<ul>
<li>Firm Commitment - the underwriter buys all the shares available for sell first, under a guaranteed price</li>
<li>Best efforts agreement - the underwriter sells the shares on the company behave without guarantee</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regulatory compliance of financial disclosures and transparency is established durint IPO</li>
<li>IPO shares can only be purchased through the underwriter with some requirement<ul>
<li>Primary Market is where investors purchase securities directly from the issuer, e.g. purchasing IPO</li>
<li>Secondary Markets is where daily tracsation happens after the securities go public</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A company&apos;s value, market cap, or market value in the stock exchange is determined by multiplying the outstanding stocks(number of shares available in the market) by the stock price, the cap ranges are as follows:<ul>
<li>Large Cap: Greater than <code>$10</code> billion</li>
<li>Mid Cap: <code>$2-$10</code> billion</li>
<li>Small Cap: Less than <code>$2</code> billion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The potential value of the company can be determined from its earning, public companies are required to report their earnings four times a year</li>
<li>A stockbroker or broker buys and sells stocks at the direction of clients. Most buy and sell orders are now made through online discount brokers</li>
<li>Broker provides two main types of account<ul>
<li>Cash account - requires that all transactions must be made with available cash or long positions</li>
<li>Margin accounts - allow investors to borrow money against the value of the securities in their account</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supply and demand in the market determine stock price, every time the stock is traded, the price changes</li>
<li>The profit of trading stocks is from buy at low and sell to high</li>
<li>Short selling is a way to make profit when stock price drops, the investor borrows shares from a brokers&apos; client and sell it to a new client at a high price, when price drops the investor purchase new shares from the market at a low price then return the shares to its original holder<ul>
<li>short selling is more risky since there is no limit for price to rise, so the potential loss has no limit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After-hours trading happens during extended hours when the major exchanges are closed, through computerized trading systems, or electronic markets<ul>
<li>Not all brokers offer after-hours trading</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>companies could buy back shares of their own stock, so the stock prices can increase</li>
<li>A stock split is when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple new shares to boost the stock&apos;s liquidity, and lower the price of the stock<ul>
<li>The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1, which means that the stockholder will have two or three shares, respectively, for every share held earlier</li>
<li>Reverse stock splits are the opposite transaction, combine multiple stocks into one</li>
<li>For each shareholder the total shares value on hand keep the same</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Historically, overall stock prices always recover and go up over time with an average annual return around <code>10%</code></li>
<li>A stock can be categorized by the following types:<ul>

<ul>
<li>Contracts are generally agreements between two parties to perform some action in the future</li>
<li>for financial contracts. These actions are often based on security prices, currency exchange rates, commodity prices or security indexes</li>

<li>Derivatives can be a contract which is a agreements between two parties to perform some action in the future for financial contracts.</li>
<li>These actions are often based on security prices, currency exchange rates, commodity prices or security indexes</li>
<li>Derivatives are a type of securities that derive values from underlyings like assets or securites<ul>
<li>In reality, the underlying of a derivative can be any know assets like interest rate, foreign currency exchange rates, market indices or other derivatives, or even weather condition</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derivatives can be <code>Exchange-Traded</code> - traded over a central exchange backed by a clearing house<ul>
<li>Trade with the clearinghouse</li>
<li>clearinghouse enforces rules like margins</li>
<li>It uses standardized contracts with standard rules and requirement, it is regulated, and generally safer</li>
<li>Trades are easy to reverse(quit) or reduce(quit parially), since they can be transferred to others in the market easily</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Derivatives can be traded <code>Over-the-Counter (OTC)</code> - traded by dealers without a central location<ul>
<li>Trade directly with the counterparty</li>
<li>It uses custom negotiated contracts, it is mostly unregulated, and exposed to default risk<ul>
<li>Default risk it the risk that either party default(fail to comply) from the agreement</li>
</ul>

<li>Derivatives can be classified according to the nature of the contract<ul>
<li>Forward commitment - A contract where the parties are required to perform some action at a given</li>
<li>Contingent claim - consists of a payoff which is only claimable if a particular event happens before the expiry of the contract</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Hedge</code> - utilize derivatives to reduce risks</li>
<li><code>Spectating</code> - utilize derivatives to gain capital</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="forwards">Forwards</h4>

<li>They are traded Over-the-Counter</li>
<li>They are forward commitment derivatives</li>
<li>At the initiation of a forward contract, one party agrees buy an asset from another party on a specified settlement date in the future at a given price(<code>Forward Price</code>)</li>
<li>It requires no payment by either party at initiation</li>
<li><code>Spot Price</code> is the current market price of the asset</li>
<li><code>Forward Price</code> is based on the spot price adjusted according by the cost of carry of the asset</li>
<li>When the contract is initiated the forward price become the <code>Contract Price</code></li>
<li>Buyer is called the <code>Long</code></li>
<li>Seller is called the <code>Short</code></li>
<li>The expected future price is the future spot price adjected by the cost of carrying<ul>
<li>Overall, long has advantage when expected future price rise and vice versa</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Forward contract specified what happen on the settlement date<ul>
<li><code>Cash Settled Forward Contract</code>(<code>Contract for Differences</code>, <code>Non-deliverable Forwards</code>) - When spot price on the settlement date is higher, long pays short the differece only without actually purchasing underlying assets and vice versa</li>
<li><code>Deliverable Forward</code> - The short is required to deliver the underlying asset to the long at the contract price no matter what the current spot price is</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="futures">Futures</h4>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Settlement Price</code> - an average of the prices of the trades during the last period of trading called the closing period<ul>
<li>it reduces the opportunity of traders to manipulate the settlement price</li>
<li>the settlement price is used to calculate the daily gain or loss at the end of each trading day</li>
<li>on its final day of trading. The settlement price is equal to the spot price of the underlying asset</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Margin</code> - a deposit from long and short to guarantee that all parties will honor their obligations<ul>
<li>an initial deposit is known as the initial margin the initial margin per contract is relatively low as compared to the size of the contract</li>
<li>this margin is deposited in the traders margin account after the futures contract is obtained</li>
<li>Changes in the price of the futures contract result in daily gains or losses they are credited to or subtracted from the margin account of the contract holder<ul>
<li>This is called the marking to market process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the maintenance margin is the minimum amount of margin that must be maintained in the margin account, it is less than the initial margin amount</li>
<li>if the balance in the account falls below the maintenance margin, additional funds must be deposited to bring the margin balance back up to the initial margin amount</li>
<li>Note that this is different from the case of an equity account which requires investors only to bring the margin back up to the maintenance margin amount</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Futures contracts may not meet the exact needs of the participants, but their liquidity and ease of trading makes them an attractive instrument for parties that want to hedge against changes in prices</li>

<li>An acquisition is when one company purchases most or all of another company&apos;s shares to gain control of that company with or without the target company&apos;s approval</li>
<li>The hedge fund manager seeks to profit from the deal spread which reflects the uncertainty of the deal closing.<ul>
<li>It could also be that the manager expects the acquirer to ultimately overpay for the acquisition and its share price suffer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The primary risk in this strategy is that the announced acquisition does not occur</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distressed/Restructuring is the strategy of buying the securities of firms in financial distress or close to bankruptcy<ul>
<li>If the hedge fund manager feels that the distressed firm is likely to be successfully restructured he/she buys the company&apos;s shares hoping that the share price will recover</li>
<li>When the prospects of the company will worsen resulting in a widening spread between the riskier and less risky securities of the company<ul>
<li>fund manager might long the senior debt and short junior debt or buy preferred stock and short common stock</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Activist shareholder is the strategy of influencing a company&apos;s policies with a goal of increasing the company&apos;s value<ul>
<li>If the hedge fund manager finds a promising firm he&apos;ll buy sufficient shares in public market, then he will have the rights to influence on the firm&apos;s policies and uses strategies to help the company grow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>special situations is the strategy of investing in the securities of firms that are currently engaged in restructuring activities like<ul>
<li>issuing or repurchasing securities</li>
<li>spinning off divisions</li>
<li>selling assets</li>
<li>distributing capital</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>relative value strategies<ul>
<li>it involves buying a security and selling short a related security with the goal of profiting when a perceived pricing discrepancy between the two is resolved.</li>
<li>the strategy is to exploit pricing discrepancies between two or more related securities, includes:<ul>
<li>Fixed income convertible arbitrage - exploit pricing discrepancies between convertible bonds and the common stock of the issuing companies</li>
<li>Fixed income asset backed to exploit pricing discrepancies among various mortgage backed securities or asset backed securities.</li>
<li>Fixed Income general to exploit pricing discrepancies between fixed income securities of various types.</li>
<li>Volatility to exploit pricing discrepancies arising from differences between returns volatility implied by options prices and manager expectations of future volatility</li>
<li>Multi strategy which is to exploit pricing discrepancies among securities across asset classes and markets other than those already mentioned</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>macro strategies<ul>
<li>it is based on global economic trends and events.</li>
<li>The hedge fund manager may take long or short positions in equities, fixed income, currencies, or commodities based on his view on overall market direction for each of these asset classes
strategies are said to have a top down approach as the investment decisions are made at the macro level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>equity hedge strategies<ul>
<li>it employs a bottom up approach where investment decisions are made according to the views on individual securities</li>
<li>Hedge fund managers apply their views on individual companies through long or short positions in publicly traded equities and equity derivative securities.</li>
<li>Examples of equity hedge strategies include<ul>
<li>Market neutral where technical or fundamental analysis is used to select undervalued equities to be held long and to select overvalued equities to be sold short<ul>
<li>the long and short positions are taken in approximately equal amounts to profit from their relative price movements with minimal exposure to market risk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quantitative directional is the use of just technical analysis to long equity securities believed to be undervalued and short securities believed to be overvalued<ul>
<li>Unlike market neutral the managers do not strive to make the long and short positions equal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fundamental growth is the use of fundamental analysis to find high growth companies. Hedge fund managers seek to identify and buy equities of companies that are expected to sustain relatively high rates of capital appreciation</li>
<li>Fundamental value is also the use of fundamental analysis to buy equity shares. But instead of focusing on high growth companies, fundamental value managers look out for undervalued companies to invest in</li>
<li>Short bias is the strategy of using technical or fundamental analysis to take predominantly short positions in overvalued equities. The hedge funds may possibly enter into smaller long positions with the market exposure is overall negative</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most hedge funds tend to specialize in a specific strategy at first. Over time some may develop or add additional areas of expertise becoming multi-strategy funds.</li>

<h4 id="standards-setting-bodies">Standards Setting Bodies</h4>
<ul>
<li>Standards setting bodies are professional not for profit organizations that establish financial reporting standards</li>
<li>Desirable attributes of standard setting bodies:<ul>
<li>all parties involved in the standard settings process should observe high professional standards<ul>
<li>including standards of ethics and confidentiality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>have adequate authority resources and competencies to fulfill its responsibilities</li>
<li>Have clear and consistent standard-setting processes</li>
<li>Guided by a well-articulated framework with a clearly stated objective</li>
<li>operate independently seeking and considering input from stakeholders but making decisions that are consistent with the stated objective of the framework</li>
<li>The decision setting process should not be compromised by pressure from external forces. It should also not be influenced self or special interests.</li>
<li>Decisions and resulting standards should be made in the public interest.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the <code>International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)</code> sets Financial Reporting Standards that have been adopted in many countries<ul>
<li>A standards setting body</li>
<li>Widely adopted outside the U.S</li>

<li><code>IASB</code> replaced <code>International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)</code> in<ul>
<li><code>IASC</code> issued the <code>International Accounting Standard (IAS)</code>. While some rules from <code>IAS</code> is still in use, <code>IASB</code> replace some of <code>IAS</code> by <code>IFRS</code></li>

<h4 id="financial-reporting-standards">Financial Reporting Standards</h4>
<ul>
<li>Standard setters are working to achieve convergence of financial reporting standards</li>
<li>To keep up to date on the evolving standards an analyst can monitor professional journals and the <code>IASB</code> and <code>FASB</code> websites, or position papers on financial reporting issues through the CFA Institute Center for Financial marketing integrity</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="ifrs">IFRS</h5>
<ul>
<li>it is a framework is the base of <code>IASB</code>&apos;s standards and their requirements for financial statements.</li>
<li><code>IASB</code> set its standards in the <code>Conceptual Framework(2010) for Financial Reporting</code><ul>
<li>The framework is designed to assist:<ul>
<li>standard setters in developing and reviewing standards</li>
<li>preparers of financial statements in applying standards and in dealing with issues not specifically covered by standards</li>
<li>auditors in forming an opinion on financial statements</li>
<li>users in interpreting financial statement information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The core of the conceptual framework is the objective to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors, in making decisions about providing resources to the entity includes:<ul>
<li>the entities financial position</li>
<li>financial performance</li>
<li>company&apos;s cash flow</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The framework defines usefulness, the information is useful if:<ul>
<li>it is Relevant - information should have predictive, value confirmatory value or both<ul>
<li>Materiality is an aspect of relevance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>it has been faithfully represented. Such information is complete neutral and free from error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are four characteristics that enhance relevance and faithful representation<ul>
<li>compatibility - the financial statement presentation is consistent among firms and across time periods</li>
<li>verifiability - independent observers will arrive at similar conclusions if they use the same methods</li>
<li>timeliness - the information is available to decision makers before it becomes stale</li>
<li>understandability - users should be able to readily understand the information the statements present</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The framework defines the reporting elements that should be included<ul>
<li>financial position mearsuring elements<ul>
<li>assets<ul>
<li>resources controlled as a result of past transactions.</li>
<li>expected to provide future economic benefits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>liabilities<ul>
<li>a result of past events</li>
<li>expected to require an outflow of economic resources in the future</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>owners equity<ul>
<li>Equity is the owner&apos;s residual interest in the assets After deducting the liabilities</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>performance measuring elements<ul>
<li>income<ul>
<li>an increase in economic benefits, either increasing assets or decreasing liabilities in a way that increases owners equity, includes <code>comprehensive income</code>, <code>revenues</code>, and <code>gains</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>expenses<ul>
<li>decreasing assets or increasing liabilities in a way that decreases owners equity</li>
<li><code>losses</code> are to be included in expenses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the framework also states that an item should be recognized in the balance sheet or
income statement if a future economic benefit from the item is probable and the items value or cost can be measured reliably<ul>
<li>the amounts at which such items are to be reported depend on the measurement base<ul>
<li>measurement bases include historical cost a motorized cost current cost realizable value present value and fair value</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the framework states two important underlying assumptions in financial statements<ul>
<li>accrual accounting - financial statements should reflect transactions at the time they actually occur not necessarily when cash is paid</li>
<li>growing concern - assumes the company will continue to exist for the forseeable future<ul>
<li>If this is not the case then presenting the company&apos;s financial position fairly requires a number of adjustments. For example it&apos;s inventory or other assets may only be worth their liquidation values</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The framework defines constraint<ul>
<li>the cost of providing the information<ul>
<li>optimally benefits derived from the information should exceed the costs.</li>
<li>The aim is to achieve a balance between costs and benefits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>non quantifiable information like reputation brand loyalty and innovation cannot be captured directly in financial statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The framework does not address the contents of the financial statements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>IAS No.1</code> defines details like which financial statements are required, Their general features and their structure and content, as:<ul>
<li>Required financial statements<ul>
<li>balance sheet</li>
<li>statement of comprehensive income<ul>
<li>It can be presented as a single statements or separately as an income statement and a statement of comprehensive income</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>statement of changes in owners equity</li>
<li>statement of cash flows</li>
<li>notes, summarising accounting policies and disclosing other items</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General features<ul>
<li>fair presentation - faithfully representing the effects of the entity&apos;s transactions and events</li>
<li>going concern basis - the financial statements are based on the assumption that the firm will continue to exist</li>
<li>accrual basis - it is used to prepare the financial statements other than the statement of cash flows</li>
<li>materiality - the financial statements should be free of misstatements or omissions like good influence the decisions of relevant parties, aggregation of similar items and separation of dissimilar items</li>
<li>No offsetting - No offsetting of assets against liabilities or income against expenses unless a specific standard permits or requires it.</li>
<li>Frequency of Reporting - frequency must be at least annually</li>
<li>comparative information for prior periods should be included unless a specified standard states otherwise</li>
<li>consistency - between periods in how items are presented and classified with prior period amounts disclosed for comparison</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structure and Content<ul>
<li>classified balance sheet showing current and non-current assets and liabilities</li>
<li>Minimum information is required on the face of each financial statement<ul>
<li>For example the face of the balance sheet must show specific items such as cash and cash equivalents, plant property and equipment and inventories</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Minimum specified no disclosures - The standard specifies disclosures about information to be presented in the footnotes</li>
<li>This information must be provided in a systematic manner and cross referenced from the face of the financial statements</li>
<li>Comparative information for prior period should be included unless a specified standard states otherwise</li>

<h5 id="us-gaap">US GAAP</h5>
<ul>
<li>Many aspects of <code>IFRS</code> and <code>US GAAP</code> have converged over the past decade</li>
<li>Compare to <code>IFRS</code>, <code>US GAAP</code> has the following difference:<ul>
<li>only revenue and expenses are listed as elements related to performance</li>
<li><code>US GAAP</code> defines an asset as a resource for which a future economic benefit is expected to flow.<ul>
<li>The <code>FASB</code> defines it simply as a future economic benefit(probable)</li>

<h3 id="technical-analysis">Technical Analysis</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is a combination of art and science, of forecasting the future price movement, that is based on an examination of the past price movements</li>
<li>It works for all tradable instrucments which have prices fluctuated overtime</li>
<li>Technical Analysis only focuses on the actual price movement, any consideration other than the price movement like financial reports and news are part of the fundamental analysis</li>
<li>It is a type of quantitaive analysis, a part of fundamental analysis that doesn&apos;t rely on numbers are qualitative analysis</li>
<li>The Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis<ul>
<li>The market discounts everything - The final price of an aset on the market has taken everything into consideration including market psychology(Efficient Markets Hypothesis)</li>
<li>Price moves in trends - A price trend can always be identifid in a efficient and transparent market</li>
<li>History tends to repeat itself - the standing point of chart patterns analysis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Types of charts<ul>
<li>Line charts - it plots the closing price over time<ul>
<li>A local maxima is called a peak, a local minima is called a trough</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bar charts - it plots a bar for the price action of each day, the highest daily price is at top of the bar and lowest daily price at the bottom of the bar, the bar is also colored in green and red to show the overall rise and fall<ul>
<li>Daily bar charts - it indicates the opening price on the left on the bar and closing price on the right</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Candlesticks charts - it plots bars which demostrate prices bounded by the opening and closing prices and use extended lines(called shadows) to show the highest and lowest prices for a selected time frame<ul>
<li>time frame can be any time intervals based on the platform software</li>
<li>Doji candles are candles that describe the same open and closing prices</li>
<li>When it has no upper and lower shadow it is called Marubozu candles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heikin Ashi charts - similar to Candlesticks but it uses the midpoint of the previous candle body as open value and use the average of open-high-low-close (OHLC) of the current period as close value<ul>
<li>It is the refined version of Candlesticks charts that filters out noises</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are different types of trading each with different focuses on the time frame:<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Online analysis platform like <a href="https://www.tradingview.com" target="_blank">TradingView</a> is a popular choice for technical analysis</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="trend-analysis">Trend Analysis</h4>
<ul>
<li>The trend of the price shows the relationship of demand of supply, the trend only changes when an external force is applied</li>
<li>Trend can be:<ul>
<li>Uptrend - the overall price has higher highs, and higher lows</li>
<li>Downtrend - the overal price has lower lows, and lower highs</li>
<li>Sideways trend - a horizontal trend during the transition period between uptrends and downtrends</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The prices alway fluctuate within a trend, short term trading can take advantages of this property</li>
<li>A trend that last for 5 to 20 years is called a secular trend</li>
<li>Trends can be categorized by time frame<ul>
<li>Major trend - long-term trend</li>
<li>Intermediate trend - 1 to 3 months trend within the major trend</li>
<li>Minor trend - trend within one month with the intermediate trend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stages are determined by the transation of trends<ul>
<li>Stage 1 - The sideways trend after a downtrend<ul>
<li>it is a consolidation phase that can be called a accumulation phase when price increases slowly</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 2 - The uptrend after stage 1</li>
<li>Excess Phase - sometimes exists in between stage 2 and stage 3, this price suddenly rises and it is a sign of stage 3<ul>
<li>Exhaustion Phase always follows the excess phase, is a sudden price drop after the excess phase</li>
<li>Excess Phase and Exhaustion Phase together, are sometimes recognized as two main parts of a stage 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 3 - The sideways trend after an uptrend<ul>
<li>It&apos;s a consolidation phase that can be a accumulation phase if price goes up or distribution phase if price goes down</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stage 4 - The downtrend after stage 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trendline is one of the most important tools in technical analysis<ul>
<li>Join all troughs will create the trend line for an uptrend(also known as support), and join the peaks for a downtrend(also known as resistance)<ul>
<li>Support or resistance are dynamic for uptrend and downtrend, when it is horizontal(sideways trendlines) it is a static support or resistance</li>
<li>Sometimes resistance can changed to a support level when price goes up, or vice versa</li>
<li>the faster the prices change the more likely the prices will break the trendlines</li>
<li>Volumn spikes drive the price to break the trendlines</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When the price is crossing the trendline, a trend is changing<ul>
<li>it can change back to the same trend but with a different slope</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Main Trand line with longer time frame can be intersected by an internal trendline with a shorter time frame</li>
<li>It is better to use logrithmic scale for the y-asix to draw the trend line<ul>
<li>the space between larger numbers are smaller</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The points used to draw trendlines should be evenly spaced</li>
<li>The local maxima can be indicated by a hanging man pattern which is a red bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart</li>
<li>The local minima can be indicated by a hammer man pattern which is a green bar with long lower shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small upper shadow in the candlesticks chart<ul>
<li>When it is a doji candle, it is called the dragonfly candle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The local maxima can be indicated by a shooting star pattern which is a red bar with long upper shadow that is at least two times the length of its body and no or small lower shadow in the candlesticks chart, it ususlly follows a green bar<ul>
<li>When it is a doji candle, it is called the gravestone candle</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Marubozu shows confidence in growth when green and decrease when red</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fibonacci retracement</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="indicators">Indicators</h4>
<ul>
<li>They can be categorized as:<ul>
<li>lagging indicator - it is a financial sign that becomes apparent only after a large shift has taken place. Therefore, lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them</li>
<li>leading indicator - it corresponds with a future movement or change in some phenomenon of interest. It helps to predict and forecast future events and trends</li>
<li>oscillator - a line graph that moves between two extremes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="lagging-indicator">Lagging Indicator</h5>
<ul>
<li>Moving Average - indicates changes in trend<ul>
<li>It calculates and, for each day, it plots the average of all previous prices in a given time frame over the price chart</li>
<li>Exponentional moving average(EMA) is preferred, it reacts quicker to small price changes</li>
<li>Simple moving average is suitable for big time frames</li>
<li>200 days moving average is popular<ul>
<li>Bull lives above(current prices are higher than average price) the a average chart, Bear lives below(current prices are lower than average price) the a average chart</li>
<li>It can also act as a support and resistent level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It only provides valuable information when martket is in trend</li>
<li>The intersections between moving average charts for various length of time frame can be used to indicate turning points</li>
<li>Different trading types use different period:<ul>
<li>Long Term Investor - uses 200, 100, 50 periods</li>
<li>Positional Trader - uses 50, 21, 14 periods</li>
<li>Intraday Trader - uses 14, 7, 3 periods</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moving Average Convergence/Divergence(MACD) - indicates changes in trend<ul>
<li>It is also recognized as a momentum oscillator</li>
<li>It shows the postive or negative difference between a &quot;fast&quot; (short period) EMA, and a &quot;slow&quot; (longer period) EMA, in a bar chart</li>
<li>When the difference is positive the price goes up, otherwise, the price goes down</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="oscillator">Oscillator</h5>
<ul>
<li>The relative strength index (RSI) - It is a momentum indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset<ul>
<li>It can have a reading from 0 to 100, high RSI value(above 70) represents overbought,low RSI value(below 30) represents oversold</li>
<li>when above 50, it is an uptrend, when below 50, it is a downtrend</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The A stochastic oscillator is a momentum indicator comparing a particular closing price of a security to a range of its prices over a certain period of time<ul>
<li>It is consisted of K line and D line ranging from 0 to 100</li>
<li>When K line cross above D line around 20, it is a buy signal</li>
<li>When K line cross below D line around 80, it is a sell signal</li>
<li>Whenever two lines falls below 20, it a signal of oversold. When two lines goes above 80, it is a signal of overbought</li>
<li>Sharpe bottom and broad top represents an uptrend and vice versa</li>
<li>Short-term market players tend to choose low settings for all variables, and vice versa</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="fibanacci-retracement">Fibanacci Retracement</h5>
<ul>
<li>It is used to predict support level in a clear uptrend or downtrend</li>
<li>The ratio of the adjecent number in a fibonacci series will approach to the golden ratio(<code>1.618</code>)</li>
<li>The ratio used in the Fibanacci retracement tools are:<ul>
<li><code>0</code></li>
<li><code>0.236</code>, which is from <code>0.618-0.382</code></li>
<li><code>0.328</code>, which is from <code>1 - 0.618</code> or <code>0.618 * 0.618</code></li>
<li><code>0.5</code>, one half</li>
<li><code>0.618</code>, which is the inverse of a golden ratio <code>1/1.618</code>, it is called the golden mean <code>0.618</code></li>
<li><code>0.786</code>, which is the square root of <code>0.618</code></li>
<li><code>0.88</code></li>
<li><code>1</code></li>
<li>Extension Level 1 - <code>1.272</code>, which is the square root of <code>1.618</code></li>
<li>Extension Level 2 - <code>2.618</code>, which is from <code>1.618 * 1.618</code></li>
<li>Extension Level 3 - <code>4.236</code>, which is from <code>2.618 * 1.618</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The ratio should be drawn between the peak and trough(a swing) from <code>1</code> to <code>0</code><ul>
<li><code>1</code> should be at the trough for an uptrend</li>
<li><code>1</code> should be at the peak for an downtrend</li>
<li>Usually, draw from left to right when using analysis platform softwares</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After drawing the scale, each ratio level can be treated as potential support level, since buyers tend to trade when those level are reached</li>
<li>Draw the scale in a reverse order(from right to left) to use the extension levels, extension levels indicates the target prices(the next peak in an uptrend or the next trough in a downtrend)</li>
<li>It is suggest to apply the scale on the current swing(the lastest known swing), and analysis on higher timeframe<ul>
<li>When new swing forms draw the new scale on the new swing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
