# Machine Learning

## Introduction

- Machines learning is one type of artificial intelligence.
  - AI is a technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.
- Machine Learning has 4 categories:
  - `supervised learning` - data with label (neural nets )
  - `unsupervised learning` - data without label
  - `semi-supervised learning` - little data with label, many other data without label.
  - `reinforcement learning` - learning from experience or similar genetic algorithm
- Deep learning is the method of using multi-layer neutral network for machine learning.
- Data science are math tools used by machine learning.
