<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>Machines learning is one type of artificial intelligence.<ul>
<li>AI is a technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Machine Learning has 4 categories:<ul>
<li><code>Supervised Learning</code> - Machine learns from data with labels, it can deals with the following tasks<ul>
<li>Classification<ul>
<li>Data are labeled manually with its class, expected to let the machine determine the class after learning from the data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regression<ul>
<li>It is a method of predicting a numeric value called target.</li>
<li>A set of attributes with value or features are provided for learning, they are called predictors, along with target values as labels.<ul>
<li><code>attribute</code> is a type of information that will be learned by the machine.</li>
<li><code>feature</code> is a type of information with a value that will be learned by the machine.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Unsupervised Learning</code> - data without label, it can deals with the following tasks.<ul>
<li>Clustering<ul>
<li>Grouping data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anomaly detection<ul>
<li>Find any data that is different from most of samples</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Novelty detection<ul>
<li>Find any data that has never been seen from all the sample data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Visualizetion<ul>
<li>Generates a 2D or 3D representation of input data points</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dimensionality Reduction<ul>
<li>Sumarize data and make them have less attributes, as known as feature extraction.</li>
<li>It can be used to prepare data before putting into others machine learning algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Association rule learning<ul>
<li>It is used to discover relations between attributes from different sample data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Semisupervised learning</code> - little data with label, many other data without label.<ul>
<li>It uses a combination of both supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Reinforcement learning</code> - learning from experience or similar genetic algorithm.<ul>
<li>An agent will be given different situation. The agent will perform observation and perform an action. The agent will be rewarded and penalized accordingly. Policy will then be establish for it to get the most reward in different situation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any ML methods can be either one of the following type:<ul>
<li>online(stochastic) learning or batch learning<ul>
<li>whether or not the learning process is done at one time(batch learning) or consequently overtime based on a stream of incoming data(online learning)</li>
<li>batch learning is also called offline learning.</li>
<li>batch learning requires a lot of computing resources while online learning uses data as mini batch which can be cheap and fast.</li>
<li>online learning is vulnerable to bad data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>instance-based learning or model-based learning<ul>
<li>instance-based will compare new data with sample data then make judgement.</li>
<li>model-based learning will generalize sample data, then processing new data based on the model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="classical-machine-learning-algorithms">Classical Machine Learning Algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Decision Trees and Random Forests</li>
<li>K-Means<ul>
<li>It is a unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering</li>
<li>It can identify discrete groupings within data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DBSCAN</li>
<li>Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA)<ul>
<li>Each Cluster group can have subgroups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One-class SVM</li>
<li>Isolation Forest</li>
<li>Principal Component Analysis(PCA)</li>
<li>Kernel PCA</li>
<li>Locally Linear Embedding(LLE)</li>
<li>t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding(t-SNE)</li>
<li>Apriori<ul>
<li>It is a type of association rules learning algorithm<ul>
<li>It can be used to find out the association of user behaviors and be used for task like movie recommandtion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It calculates three values:<ul>
<li>Support: divide the number of users interested in the topic by the total number of users.</li>
<li>Confidence: divide the number of users interested in the related topic by the number of users interested in the original topic.</li>
<li>Lift, divide the confidence score by the support score.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This algorithm compares all possible combination from the sample.<ul>
<li>Each combination is a potential rule.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only the samples have support and confidence scores higher than the minimum value set at the beginning of the calculation will be recorded.</li>
<li>The final result will rank the lift score from high to low.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eclat<ul>
<li>It is a type of association rules learning algorithm</li>
<li>It only has a support score which is calculated by dividing the rule set by the total number of samples</li>
<li>It also need to set a minimum support value and the support score will be ranked from high to low as the final result.</li>
</ul>

<li>Linear regression is used to find the best fitting line(not nesscessirily straight) of a set of data points</li>
<li>suitable for solving regression problems that find a predicted value.</li>
<li>Ordinary least squares is used to calculate the best fit<ul>
<li>find the minimum value of the square of the difference of y and y hat.</li>
<li>y hat is the predicted value while y is the actual value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simple linear regression - The model will be a linear function with one constant, one dependent variable and one independent variable <code>x</code> times a coefficient.</li>
<li>Multiple linear regression has one constant, one dependent variable and many combinations of independent variables times a coefficient.<ul>
<li>Each independent variable represents a different feature in a single row of data.</li>
<li>Dummy Variable - For a categorical featue each possible category will form a new field with value 0 or 1, when the current row of data is belonds this a certain category the value for this category will be 1 and others are 0.<ul>
<li>Dummy Variable Trap - The number of this categorical independent variable will always be one less than the total number of the possible options since all others are 0 implys this record belong to the last category already.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<ul>
<li>It was first introduced in 1980s, it was getting popular recently only becase the improved stroage and computing</li>
<li>Can be used for both regression and classification tasks.</li>
<li>Most Neural Networks are consist of a Feedforward Process and Backpropagation.<ul>
<li>FeedForward Process(Nerual Network) uses static mapping as the output only depend on the input and the weights</li>
<li>Going from output to input and finding the better weights for the model using stochastic gradient descent with the chain rule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In neural science, each neuron has dedrites(receiver) and axon(transmitter), millions of millions of neuron work together. sigals are passed through synapses.</li>
<li>In neural networks, the processing unit is called neuron or node. The connection between neuron is also called synapse.</li>
<li>Overfitting and Underfitting - Underfitting(High Bias) implys a model that is too simply to make prediction, Overfitting(High Variance) implys a model that is learning too hard from the train data and too complicated to effectively and correctly make prediction.<ul>
<li>The goal is to aim to build a model that is a bit overfitting and slightly adjust it to prevent overfitting.</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li>Nodes in between are called hidden layers, each layers will process values and generate output for the next layer.<ul>
<li>Each neuron in the same layer focuses on different aspects of the input info.</li>
<li>Hidden layers can have as many as possible, the neural network can be called deep learning if there are lots of layers of neurons in between.</li>
<li>ANNs with fewer hidden layers can be called shallow learning.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The final output will be compared with the labeled target value, and use back propagation to adjust all weights of synapse, in order to achieve a higher accuracy.<ul>
<li><code>y</code> is the actually value, <code>y</code> hat the is output value.</li>
<li>A cost function is used to calculate the difference between <code>y</code> and <code>y</code> hat. The most frenquely used cost function is mean squared error which divides the squares of the difference of <code>y</code> and <code>y</code> hat by 2.</li>
<li>During each back propagation all of the weight for each synapse in the entire neural network are adjusted at the same time.</li>
<li>All the weight are initially set to a random small number close to zero.</li>
<li>Learning rate can be set to control how much the weights can be adjusted at a time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A single layer feed forward nerual network(perceptron) is the base machine learning unit in ANNs.</li>
<li>There are several ways of adjust the weights:<ul>
<li>Try all possible combination of weight values and calculate its cost function value, this is not practically since it takes billions of years.(curse of dimensionality)</li>
<li>Gradient Descent - adjust the combination of weights by calculating the slope, hence each trials will move closer to the minimum value. The sum of cost functions of all rows of data in the dataset are calculated in one guess.<ul>
<li>It might find the local minimum if all the cost function values are not convex.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stochastic Gradient Descent - Similar to gradient descent, but make adjustment based on cost function of every single row of data.<ul>
<li>It will find the global minimum.</li>
<li>It is light weight and faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>CNNs will process an image in the following order:<ul>
<li>Convolution operation is to use a feature detector to generate a feature map.<ul>
<li>The feature detector is a small matrix(2-D array) that has a certain predefined value in it. Its has different sizes in various CNNs.</li>
<li>The feature detector(filter) will be moving across the image(all pixel will only be processed once, line by line) and count the number of matches(non-zero) found when it overlapse with the image.<ul>
<li>A stride the step the feature detector moves across the image.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Feature detector has negtive value to dim the image pixel and positive value to highlight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A feature map(convolved feature) will be generated according to hte stride and feature detector size, the feature map will summarize the feature of the image.</li>
<li>Multiple feature detectors will be used on a single image and generate various feature maps that each emphasis on different features of the image.</li>

<li>Back propagation in CNNs not only change weight, it also changes feature dectectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The last fully connected layer will vote for the result for image recognition.</li>
<li>The softmax function is used to calculation possibilities of each result for image recogition so possibilities of all possible answers add up to 1.</li>

<li>Replacing missing values by the average of all other values.</li>
<li>Encoding categorical data - generating dummy variables.</li>
<li>Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set.</li>
<li>Feature Scaling - put all the features on the same scales.<ul>
<li>Not all models need to have feature scaling.</li>
<li>Applied on training set only.</li>
<li>There are two ways for Feature Scaling<ul>
<li>Standardization returns a result from -3 to 3, Standardization alway works.</li>
<li>Normalization returns a result from 0 to 1, Normalization works only if data have a normal distribution in most of the features.</li>

<ul>
<li>Hyperparameters Tuning can be done during model building and model training.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="build-model">Build Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hyperparameters in the build model step is called Model Hyperparameters.</li>
<li>Generally, the ideal number of nodes in each hidden layer is close to half of the input layer nodes plus output layer nodes.<ul>
<li>Fine tuning can be made to improve, however this approximate number is good enough for determining the number of nodes for all hidden layers.</li>
<li>The number nodes in each hidden layer determines the capacity of the model to learn a complex model. When the capacity is greater than needed it will learn to much and cause overfitting.</li>
<li>the first hidden layer is suggested to have more nodes than the input layer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the number of layers<ul>
<li>For the number of hidden layer, 3 layer is way better 2. A 4, 5, 6 layers ANNs won&apos;t necessarily increase the accurancy greatly.</li>
<li>More convolutional layer will increase the accuracy of the prediction.</li>
<li>The more fully connected hidden layers, the better the model predict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Transfer Learning for CNNs - Use good trained model that can accomplish similar tasks.<ul>
<li>One technique is to remove the last few convolutional layers then train the data since only those layers are reponsible for specific feature detecting for trained model&apos;s own labeling strategy.</li>
<li>Fine-Tuning - replace the last fully connected layers with a new layer then train the model based on existing weight from trained model.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>It controls how fast weight changes during gradient descent.</li>
<li>0.01 suggested starting value.</li>
<li>If to small it will take longer steps to find the best weight, if too big the algorithm might not be able to find the best weight.</li>
<li>Learning rate decay is an algorithm that helps the model to find the best weight.<ul>
<li>it can decrease the learning rate linearly or exponentially after a certain epochs.</li>
<li>Adaptive Learning Rate changes learning rate dynamically based on the data and training result after each epoch.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Minibatch size<ul>
<li>It is 2^n and it can be anywhere from 1 - 256, 32 is a good starting point, then 64, 128, 256.</li>
<li>Larger batch size requires more computational resources, and it might cause out of memory errors.</li>

<li>F1 Score = harmonic mean of Precision and Recall = <code>2*Precision*Recall / (Precision + Recall)</code><ul>
<li>F1 Score closer to 1 is better. Closer to 0 is worse.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Area Under Curve (AUC)<ul>
<li>AUC is the area of a curve formed by plotting True Positive Rate against False Positive Rate at different cut-off thresholds</li>
<li>Good model have AUC closer to 1</li>
<li>0.5 is considered random guess</li>
<li>Closer to 0 is unusual and it indicates model is flipping results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use one class again all other classes for multiclass classifier.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="cap">CAP</h5>
<ul>
<li>The number of correct prediction is on the y-axis. The total number of prediction is on the x-axis.</li>
<li>A a random prediction will generate a linear line.</li>
<li>A better model will generate a curve with higher slope at the beginning</li>
<li>There is a perfect linear model that get every prediction correct.</li>
<li>If the area under the line for random model is <code>Sr</code> and <code>Sp</code> for the perfect model, the area under the curve for the model is <code>S</code>. The accuracy rate can be calculated with <code>(S-Sr)/(Sp-Sr)</code>.</li>
<li>A good model can be determined by curve when the x value is in the middle of x-asix the point on the curve will have y-value at above 70% of the y-axis</li>
