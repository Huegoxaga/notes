AI is a technique which enables machines to mimic human behaviour.

Machines learning is the process of using data to answer questions.

Deep learning is the method of using multi-layer neutral network for machine learning.

data science are math tools used for machine learning.

Machine Learning 4 category:

supervised learning- data with label (neural nets )
unsupervised learning- data without label
semi-supervised learning-little data with label, many other data without label.
reinforcement learning - learning from experience or similar genetic algorithm
