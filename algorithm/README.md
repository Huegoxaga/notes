# Data Structures

- Data structure is a systematic way of organizing and accessing data.

## Integer

- Unsigned interger has range `[0, 2^bitSize - 1]` where the `bitSize` is the number of bits
- Signed interger has range `[-2^(bitSize-1), 2^(bitSize-1) - 1]` where the `bitSize` is the number of bits

## Array

- An ordered collection of data.
- It has indices for access the elements, usually starts at 0 from left to right.
- It has a fixed size, defined when the array is declared.

## List

- like an array but its size can be changed after the declaration.
- The first element in the list has index = 0.
- Every element on the list other than the first has a predecessor.
- Every element on the list other than the last has a successor.

### Array List

- They are Lists data structures designed base on array data structures.
- Also known as vector in C++ or earliest versions of Java.
- It internally declares a new array everything when the list size changes.
- Dynamic array is a technique used to improve the data structure. It always declares some empty elements on both sides of the array to lower the chances for creating and copying the array, every time the array change sizes.
- It uses contiguous allocation, list elements occupy consecutive memory locations.
  - Insertion or deletion of elements in the middle of the list involves the laborious relocation of all elements that come after.
- It allows random access access elements by jumping to any given element without going through its predecessors.

### Linked List

- A type of list that treats all of its elements as nodes.
- The nodes not only has the value for the element, it also stores a reference(link) to its adjacent elements.
- The reference to a linked list is just the reference to the head node.
- It uses linked allocation.
- It uses sequential access, it accesses nodes starting from the head all the time.
- This type of data structure is referred to a self-referential structure or recursive data structure.
- An empty list is represented with a head reference whose value is null.
- Link Lists have the following types:
  - Singly Linked Lists - All of its node has a reference to the next node of the list.
    - The first node is called the head, the last node is call the tail.
    - The tail node has a null reference.
  - Circularly Linked Lists - When a singly linked list has its tail node reference to the head node, the head and the tail are connected to form a circularly linked list.
  - Doubly Linked Lists - All of its node not only has a reference to the next node, but also has a reference to the previous node.
    - provide easy access to both side of certain node.
    - There is header node at the beginning and tailer node at the end.
    - Header node and tailer node do not store data. Together, they are called sentinels or guards, to protect the boundary, because either next node or previous node of the sentinels are not defined.
- Removing Nodes
  - To remove the first node of a list, set the head reference to its successor.
  - To remove a node other than the first, set a reference to the predecessor of the targeted node. Route the successor link in the predecessor around the targeted node.

### Positional List

- It uses a cursor instead of indices to locate each elements.

## Stack

- It is a collection of objects are inserted and removed according to the last-in, first-out principle.
- It is originated from a stack of plates in a spring-loaded, cafeteria plate dispenser.
- Inserting data is called push, removing data is called pop.
- A stack can be implemented by using an array to hold the items being stored.
  - need a variable called `top` which stores the end index(the first empty slot) for the stack in the array.
  - The exception thrown when an attempt is made to push a value onto a stack whose array if full is called a stack overflow exception.
  - The exception thrown when an attempt is made to pop an empty stack is sometimes called stack underflow.
- ArrayList can be used to create a generic stack structure.
- A linked list can be used to implement a stack by using the head node object of the list as the "top" of the stack.

## Queue

- Queues are first-in, first-out. It has a first come, first server principle.
- Adding data to the `rear` is called enqueue, removing data from the `front` is call dequeue.
- For an array-based implementation, it should:
  - track the front and rear of the array. Adding new elements and removing old elements in order of increasing index.
  - wrap around to the beginning of the array when the queue reaches the end.
  - Use an integer variable to track the size.
- A linked list can be used to implement a queue.
  - The head of the linked list is used as the front of the queue.
  - The end of the linked list is used as the rear of the queue.

### Priority Queue

- A queue that has all of its element with a priority key.
- When dequeuing an element the priority key is considered first. Then, among all the elements with the highest priority, first-in, first-out.
- The key can be called minimal key. When represented by an integer, usually a lower number has a higher priority.

## Deck

- It also known as double-ended queues.
- It supports insertion and deletion at both the front and the end of the queue.

## Tree

- It stores objects in a hierarchical structure, like a tree.
- The top node is called the root.
- Each node(except root) has one parent node, and zero or more child node.
- All nodes with a common parent are called siblings.
- A node is called internal if it has a child node.
- A node is called external or leaf if it has no child node.
- An edge of a tree is a pair of a node with parent and child relationship, the order does not matter.
- A path of a tree is a serial of nodes with direct parent and child relationships.
- The depth is used to describe how many levels a node is below the root node.
- The height is used to describe the max depth among all nodes for a tree.
- The subtree is generated by treating a tree's node as the root of a new tree.
- nodes on one the same path have the ancestor and descendant relationship.

### Ordered Tree

- A tree structure that place all the sibling nodes in an order.

### Binary Tree

- All of the nodes have at most two children.
- The children of the nodes are described as the left child and the right child.
  - The left child may be a root of a left subtree, the same for the right child.
- The children are ordered as the left child is the first child.
- For a proper binary tree, all of its internal nodes have two children. Otherwise, it can be called an improper binary tree.
- Traversal of a tree is a way of access all nodes of a tree.
- It can be implemented using the same concept as a linked-list. Each node will have a value and two links to the left child node and right child node.
  - A binary tree is represented by a reference to its root node.
  - An empty binary tree is represented with a reference whose value is null.
- There are three recursive traversal techniques for binary tree:
  - `Preorder traversal` - visits the root first, and then recursively traverses the left and right subtrees.(recursive methods for left and right subtree run last)
  - `Inorder traversal` - traverses the left subtree, then visits the root, and then traverses the right subtree.(recursive methods for left subtree run first, recursive methods for right subtree run last)
    - traverses in a sorted order, from smallest to largest.
  - `Postorder traversal` - traverses the left and right subtrees, and then visits the root.(recursive methods for left and right subtree run first)
- Types of binary trees:
  - `Full Binary Tree` is a Binary Tree in which every node has 0 or 2 children
  - `Complete Binary Tree` has all levels completely filled with nodes except the last level and in the last level, all the nodes are as left side as possible
  - `Perfect Binary Tree` is a Binary Tree in which all internal nodes have 2 children and all the leaf nodes are at the same depth or same level
  - `Balanced Binary Tree` is a Binary tree in which height of the left and the right sub-trees of every node may differ by at most `1`
  - `Degenerate(or Pathological) Binary Tree` is a Binary Tree where every parent node has only one child node
- Application of binary trees:
  - `Binary Search Tree` - Used in many search applications where data is constantly entering/leaving, such as the map and set objects in many languages' libraries.
    - Left child is always smaller than the root, Right child is always bigger than the root.
    - To implement the binary search tree, adding and searching methods are recursive with base cases that check if the root is empty and non-base case that traverses the tree.
    - To remove a node in the binary search tree. There are three cases:
      - Removal of a Leaf Node
      - Removal of a Node with a single Child
      - Removal of a node with two child node
        - For this case, the node will be replaced by the largest node from its left subtree. Then, reorganinze the rest.
  - `Binary Space Partition` - Used in almost every 3D video game to determine what objects need to be rendered.
  - `Binary Trees` - Used in almost every high-bandwidth router for storing router-tables.
  - `Hash Trees` - used in p2p programs and specialized image-signatures in which a hash needs to be verified, but the whole file is not available.
  - `Huffman Coding Tree` - used in compression algorithms, such as those used by the .jpeg and .mp3 file-formats.
  - `Syntax Tree` - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions.
  - `T-tree` - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive, databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so.

### Heap

- It can be used to improve the performance of a priority queue.
- It is a binary tree that stores a key and a value in all of its nodes.
- It also need to satisfy the following requirement.
  - In a max-heap, the child node key is always greater or equal to its parent node key.
  - In a min-heap, the child node key is always smaller or equal to its parent node key.
  - Except the nodes with the highest depth of the tree, all nodes have two children(full). This guarantee the tree has minimal height.

## Maps

- It has a collection of key-value pairs(also called entries or mapping).
- Key can be of any data type, and they are unique.
- It is also known as associative arrays.
- The key and value are generally not stored in the same object.

### Hash table

- A structure that help implement maps.
- In a hash table all possible keys in a map can found its associated integer values in the table.
- It use hash function or hash algorithm is consist of hash code and compression function.
  - Hashcode finds or converts the integer value of all keys in the ordered hash table.
    - A good hash code can avoid getting the same integer value as much as possible(avoid collisions).
    - For Integer objects, you can use the integer value of the object (or its absolute value).
    - For Character objects, you can use the UNICODE value for the character.
    - For String objects, you can use a function that takes into account the UNICODE values of the characters that make up the string, as well as the position occupied by each character.
    - For Object types, you can use some function on the non-mutable components of the object.
  - Compression function generate and rearrange the new collection that has the same length as the map.

### Multimap

- They are maps that allows a key maps to multiple values.

### Linked Map

- A ordered map.
- Generally based on the insertion order.

## Set

- A unordered collection of elements, contains unique values only.
- Support membership operation for sets defined in Math.
- Internally Set are treated as Keys of a map.
- The hash function for HashSet has the following features.
  - Elements are usually broken down into groups by the compression function, then they are stored in an array of bucket.
  - Each bucket can have an array of element for the same group.
  - Each bucket has an array of elements with the same length.

### Multiset

- Also known as bag, are set that allow duplicated values.

### Linked Set

- An ordered Set.
- Generally based on the insertion order.

# Algorithm

- An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for performing some task in a finite amount of time.
- Shorter running time is the major indication of a better data structure or algorithm.

## Basic Concepts

### Iteration

- A method that called repeatedly in a loop.

### Recursion

- A method that calls itself is a recursive method.
- It has a base case, the program will call the method recursively until the first base case is reached, then move on to the next top level method that hasn't been resolved
- Recursive methods can have the following types:
  - Linear Recursion - Each recursive method call itself once.
  - Binary Recursion - Each recursive method call itself twice.
  - Multiple Recursion - Each recursive method call itself more than twice.
- For binary and multiple recursion, the methods call itself as deep as possible than call the sibiling methods after all its recursive methods are called

- Related Algorithmic Techniques
  - Dynamic Programming
    - Commonly referred to as DP
    - It optimizes native recursive algorithm by saving the intermeditate result from recursive calls in a list in the memory, it reduces the complex of a recursive algorithm that would take exponential time further by pruning duplicated recursive calls when the result of a similar method call can be find in the result list
  - Backtracking
    - It is a technique that recursively build a solution incrementally and remove all the solutions that does not satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time
    - The goal is to explore all possible solutions to a problem using the brute force approach
    - A search tree named state-space tree is used. In a state-space tree, each branch is a variable, and each node represents a solution
    - Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for searching a tree data structure for a node that satisfies a given property. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. Extra memory, usually a queue, is needed to keep track of the child nodes that were encountered but not yet explored
    - the depth-first search (DFS) method is performed on the tree. It reaches the bottom of the tree first, since the next node from upper level will continue to execute, it looks like the path has been backtracked
      - a bounding function is applied so that the algorithm can check if the so-far built solution satisfies the constraints, when solution from one node failed to meet the constraints, the recursion stops.

### Parallel

- an algorithm which can do multiple operations in a given time
- Foster’s Methodology - It states four stages of developing parallel programs
  - Partitioning - Decompose the large problem into many smaller problems
    - Domain (or Data) Decomposition
      - Example: Breaking up our matrix in our matrix multiplication problem
    - Functional Decomposition
      - Example: Breaking up the different tasks (operations) that need to be performed
  - Communication - Establish how to co-ordinate and share data between tasks or threads
    - May not always be required
  - Agglomeration or Aggregation - Optimization
    - Looking for any sequential tasks, or points where a task might be waiting
    - Looking for tasks that are doing a lot of communication, then merge then into one task if possible
  - Mapping - Assigning tasks to processors / threads
    - Minimize total execution time by
      - Assigning tasks to different processors, so they can execute concurrently
      - Assigning tasks to the same processors, when those tasks communicate between each other frequently
    - Doesn't apply if
      - It runs on a single core
      - It is controlled by a system with automated task scheduling

## Algorithm Analysis

It is used to tell if a data structure or Algorithm is good.

- `Greedy` is a term to describe an algorithm that is be short-sighted, heavily working on the current problem without seeing the whole picture
- Experimental studies, run methods, output current time before and after the operation, calculate and record the elapsed time for comparison. All irrelevant conditions are controlled.
  - Different elapsed time may obtained among identical tests due to background services of the testing device.
  - the biggest issue with experimental analysis is the Algorithm must be completed for testing.
  - IDEs like NetBeans contains a profiler that will indicate the amount of time spent in each function and on what lines in a function.
- Counting Primitive Operations, an algorithm can be measured by counting the following primitive operations it has:
  - Assigning a value to a variables
  - Following an object reference
  - Performing an arithmetic operation
  - Comparing two numbers
  - Accessing a single element of an array by index
  - Method overhead
    - Calling a method - allocate memory for parameters and local variables
    - Returning from a method - store the address of where control returns after the method terminates.
- Asymptotic Analysis
  - A computational problem is a problem that is meant to be solved by an algorithm.
  - A computational problem is described by specifying the data to be input to the algorithm, and the output that should be produced by the algorithm
  - Each possible input is called an instance of the problem. For analysis the instance size `N` is only taken into consideration.
  - There are two types of complexity:
    - the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm.
    - Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working storage an algorithm needs.

### Performance Evaluation

- Throughput - Number of tasks completed / given amount of time
  - Expressed as the actions completed per unit of time
  - Example a processor can execute X number of tasks per second
- Latency - time / task (time per task)
  - Expressed in a unit of time
  - Example takes a task 50 milliseconds to complete

#### Time Complexity

- Generally larger input run slower.
- This method focus on studying the growth rate of primitive operation count related to the growth of input size.
- When convert operation count into running time. For inputs with the same sizes, running time may vary. However, the worst-case is usually taken as the running time for this input size. It is good for code improvement.
- The running time `T(n)` equals the sum of the product of the time cost of each statement (line of code) multiply by the number of times executed
- For logarithm function in computer science, the 2 in base 2 is often omitted, written as `logx` or `lgx`. It looks similar to LOG with base 10.
- The Big O math model is used to simplify operation count functions for comparison.
  - A function `f(x)` can be converted to the big-Oh of another function `g(x)`. if the y value of `f(x)` is always smaller or equal than `g(x)` times a constant for all x value greater than certain constant.
    - Then the generalized big-Oh function can be used to represent the complexity of the algorithm.
    - In terms of the complexity, `O(1)<O(log(n))<O(n)<O(nlog(n))<O(n^2)<O(2^n)<O(n!)`.
    - `O(1)` Constant Time: means the number of operations has no thing to do with input size.
    - `O(n)` Linear Time: means the number of operations is linear input size.
    - `O(log n)` Logarithmic Time: means the input size is equals 2 to the power of the number of operations.
    - `O(n log n)` usually means a `O(log n)` algorithm has an `O(n)` as its inner loop or outer loop.
    - `O(n^2)` Quadratic Time: means the number of operations is equals the input size times itself.
    - When finding Big O, `g(x)` should be in its simplest form.
  - Big-Omega function is found if `f(x)` is greater or equal than `g(x)` time constant `c`.
  - Big-Theta is found if `f(x)` can be in between a function `g(x)` times two different constant.

#### Parallel Computations

- Speedup is used to compare the increase in speed when program switched from sequential to parallel, it equals to `sequential execution time / parallel execution time with N workers`
  - When parallel shorten the execution time, the speedup is great than `1`
  - Theoretically, if each core can reduce the time by half, the speedup for a four cores machine is `4`.
  - For the actual speedup calculation uses the above formula, input the actual value from measurement
    - Measurement should be an average of a large number of execution time
- Efficiency - `Actual Speedup / Number of Processors`
  - It shows how much advantage an additional core can bring to the program, in terms of percentage
- Amdahl’s Law - it predicts how much speed up can be achieved through parallelization, because based on the logic and purpose of the program, only a part of it can adopts parallelization
  - It states that the overall speedup equals $$\frac{1}{(1-P)+\frac{P}{S}}$$
  - `P` means the percentage of the program that can be done in parallel
  - `S` is the corresponding speedup value for the parallel portion of the program
  - It proves that the larger the parallel portion is in the program the greater the program can benefit from using multi-cores

## Types of Algorithm

### Search Algorithm

- A search algorithm is a method of locating a specific item in a larger collection of data.
- This type of algorithm is referred to as "Brute Force" as potentially all elements need to be visited.

#### Sequential Search

- It use a loop to: sequentially step through an array.
- compare each element with the search value
- stop when the value is found or the end of the array is encountered.
- It can be used with any array.
- Sequential Search searches from one end to another end, it has the following two types.
  - findFirst return the index for the first found value, -1 if not found. Worst case `O(n)`.
  - findAll - When X is found record the position and continue. At the end of the array return all the positions. If X is never found, return an empty list of position, for all cases `O(n)`.

#### Binary Search

- It can only be used with sorted arrays, but is much faster than Sequential Search.
- Steps for binary search:
  1. compare target value with the median values(round down if the mid position is not an integer). check equality first, if not determine the location the target in either upper or lower section
  2. compare the target with the median of the lower or upper section until it is found.
- Example of Recursive Binary Search:

```java
int binarySearch(int A[], int lower, int upper, int X){
  // check base case for missing X
  if (lower > upper)
    return -1;
  // check if X is at the middle
  int middle = (lower + upper)/2;
  if (A[middle] == X)
    return middle;
  // determine which segment to continue search in
  if (A[middle] < X)
    return binSearch(A, middle+1, upper, X);
  else
    return binSearch(A, lower, middle-1, X);
}
```

- Worst case `O(logN)`.

### Sort

An array is sorted in ascending order if the array entries increase as indices increase.

- In-place means that the algorithm does not use extra space for manipulating the input but may require a small though non-constant extra space for its operation

#### Bubble Sort

- Steps for bubble sort:
  1. compare each value(from left to right one by one) with its next value to the right.
  2. when a bigger value is found, always swap the bigger one to the right, so one biggest value in each iteration should be places the end.
  3. Exclude the value found in the previous iteration by shorten the length of the loop by one
  4. repeat the process n times for n is the number of input.
- The complexity of Bubble Sort is `О(n^2)` (worst case).
- Example:

```java
for (int last=N-1; last>=1; last--){
  // Move the largest entry in A[0...last] to A[last]
  for (int index=0; index <= last-1; index++){     //swap adjacent elements if necessary
    if (A[index] > A[index+1]){
      int temp = A[index];
      A[index] = A[index+1];
      A[index + 1] = temp;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Selection Sort

- Steps for Selection sort:
  1. Reset the leftmost element as the temp max value.
  2. Comparing the temp max value with rest values in the array. If a bigger one is found, set it as the temp max value.
  3. After the comparison in one iteration, swap the max value to its proper location according to a count number that count the rank of the max value of each iteration.
- The time complexity of Selection Sort is `О(n^2)`(worst case).
- Example:

```java
for (last = N -1; last >= 1; last --)
{
  // Move the largest entry in A[0...last] to A[last]
  // Determine position of largest in A[0..last] and store
  // in maxIndex
  int maxIndex = 0;
  for (int index = 1; index <= last; index++)
  {
    if (A[index] > A[maxIndex])
    maxIndex = index;
  }
  // maxIndex is position of largest in A[0..last]
  // swap A[maxIndex] with A[last]
  int temp = A[maxIndex];
  A[maxIndex] = A[last];
  A[last] = temp;
}
```

#### Insertion Sort

- Steps for insertion sort:
  1. From left to right, starting with the second element, compare it with the first if it is smaller or equals to the first, place it before the first element.
  2. For the third element, compare it with the second, then the first. If the third is smaller than or equals with any element, place it before it.
  3. repeat the process to the last element. In the end all elements are placed into the right location.
- The complexity of Insertion Sort is `О(n^2)` (worst case).
- Example:

```java
//A[0..0] is sorted
for (index = 1; index <= N-1; index ++)
{
  // A[0..index-1] is sorted
  // insert A[index] at the right place in A[0..index]
  int unSortedValue = A[index];
  scan = index;
  while (scan > 0 && A[scan-1] > unSortedValue)
  {
    A[scan] = A[scan-1];
    scan --;
  }
  // Drop in the unsorted value
  A[scan] = unSortedValue;
  // Now A[0..index] is sorted
}
  // Now A[0..N-1] is sorted, so entire array is sorted
```

#### Merge Sort

- Steps for merge sort:
  1. cut the array with `n` elements in half recursively, until there are `n` array contains only one element
  2. compare elements in each array with the lowest current index, and place them in order in a larger array with doubled size
  3. repeat the process until merging into one big sorted array
- The complexity of Merge Sort is `O(nlog(n))` (worst case).
- Since each compared value is copied to the new array, the merge sort does require new temporary arrays.

#### Quick Sort

- Steps for quick sort:
  1. Set a Pivot point(usually the middle point).
  2. Compare pivot point with rest of the array, move all smaller value to the left and greater values or equal value to the right. Then the pivot point has the sorted index location.(This step is called Partition).
  3. Do the same procedure for the left and right sublists. Get two more sorted points.
  4. Repeat until all sublists has a length of 1 or 0.
- The complexity of Quick Sort is `О(n^2)` (worst case).
- Example:

```java
void doQuicksort(int A[], int start, int end)
{
  if (start < end)
  {
    // partition A[start..end]
    // and get the pivot point
    int pivotPoint = partition(A, start, end);
    // recursively do the first sublist
    doQuicksort(A, start, pivotPoint-1);
    // recursively do the second sublist
    doQuicksort(A, pivotPoint+1, end);
  }
}
int partition(int A[ ], int start, int end)
{
  // See implementation for improved midpoint selection
  int pivotValue = A[start];
  endOfLeftList = start;
  // At this point A[endOfLeftList] == pivotValue
  for (int scan = start + 1; scan <= end; scan ++)
  {
    if (A[scan] < pivotValue)
    {
      endOfLeftList++;
      swap(A, endOfLeftList, scan);
      // At this point A[endOfLeftList] < pivotValue
    }
  }
  // Move the pivotValue between the left and right sublists
  swap(A, start, endOfLeftList);
  return endOfLeftList;
}
```

### Distance and Similarity Calculation

#### Euclidean Distance

- It Calculates the straight distance from one point to another using Pythagorean' theorem
- In a Euclidean space, find the square root of the sum of square of all difference along all axes
- It is a dissimilarity function

#### Manhattan Distance

- It calculates the sum of the distances along the axes, e.g. from point A to point B on a map is 4 block east and 2 block north, with a total of 6 blocks
- Find the sum of the absolute difference along all axes
- It is a dissimilarity function

#### Minkowski Distance

- It is a generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distance
- The distance between point `t` and point `p` is $$d_{minkowski} =\left ( \sum_{i=1}^n|t_i-p_i|^m \right)^\frac{1}{m}$$, where $$t_n$$ is the value of `t` on `n` axis, same goes for $$p_n$$
  - When `m = 1` (L1 norm), the formula is calculating Manhattan distance
  - When `m = 2`(L2 norm), the formula is calculating Euclidean distance

#### Cosine Similarity

- It calculates how similar two vectors are, by geting the cosine value of the two vectors using the dot product formula, which is dividing the dot product by the product of their magnitude
- It is a similarity function

### Assignment Algorithm

- It is a problem in combinatorial optimization

#### Hungarian(Munkres Assignment) Algorithm

- It is used to find the smallest sum of elements from a square matrix, when only one element can be selected from each row and column
- Using brutal force will result a time complexity of `O(n!)`
- Hungarian Algorithm helps to speed up with a time complexity of `O(n^3)`
- Steps:
  1. Substract the smallest element of each row from all elements of each row
  2. Substract the smallest element of each column from all elements of each column
  3. Connect all the zeros using minimum numbers of lines, where `n` lines should be used for a `n X n` matrix
     - If lines used is smaller than `n`, substract all unconnected elements by the smallest one of them, then add the number to the intersection of the lines, then go back to step `3`, as a result the line number will increase by one, if `n` is still small repeat this additional step again
     - This additional step can be repeated as many as `n` times when `n` is initially `1`, and causing the final highest time complexity of this algorithm is equals `n`(line number) multiply by `n^2`(element scaning in this step), which is `O(n^3)`
  4. Find one zero in each row and column, and use the original element that located the zero's position to do the sum, then obtain the final result
- For solving problems involves non-square matrix, fit it with the smallest square matric and fill the missing elements with zeros, and discard the assignment for these position in the final step

### Path Finding Algorithms

- Algorithm that finds the shortest paths between nodes in a graph
- Eulerian circuits and Eulerian path focus on edges, and aim for covering all the edges
  - Eulerian circuits returns to the starting vertex and Eulerian path doesn't
- Hamiltonian circuits and Hamiltonian path focus on vertices, and aim for covering all the vertices
  - Hamiltonian circuits forms a circle and Hamiltonian path doesn't

#### Königsberg Bridge Problem

- It's about finding the unique path to cross all bridges when a group of islands are connected by multiple bridges
- Euler states that there will be an optimal solution only when there are zero or two island that is connected to an odd number of bridges. When there are two such bridges, the solution path starts at one of these bridges and ends at the other
  - This solution is proved by Carl Hierholzer
  - Such solution path is then called the Eulerian path
- An alternative form of the problem asks for a path that traverses all bridges and also has the same starting and ending point. Such a walk is called an Eulerian circuit or an Euler tour. Such a circuit exists if, and only if, the graph is connected, and there are no nodes of odd degree (connected to an odd number of bridges) at all.
  - All Eulerian circuits are also Eulerian paths, but not all Eulerian paths are Eulerian circuits

#### Dijkstra's Algorithm

- It finds the shortest time to get to all the next intermeditate nodes from the starting point to the destination, only the path that takes the shortest time to the next nodes will be adopted and will be used to reach further nodes
- When the length of all edge in a graph is the same, it is an unweighted graph, then Breath-first search algorithm can be used
- Dijkstra's Algorithm is a BFS algorithm for weighted graph

#### `A*` Search Algorithm

- It is pronounced as "A-star" search algorithm
- It optimzes the Dijkstra's Algorithm by adding a heuristic function
  - The heuristic function returns an direct distance from the source to the destination, so the program can have a general sense of the general direction for searching
  - The `h` distance to the destination for each node that calculated from the heuristic function will be added to the actual distance traveled (`g`) to get to the node for path selection
    - The sum of `h` and `g` distance is the `f` distance for a node
- Open set or list refers to the nodes that will be evaluated or visited
- Closed set or list refers to the nodes that has been evaluated or visited
- Steps:
  1. Add the starting square (or node) to the open list
  2. Repeat the following:
     - A) Look for the node with lowest F cost on the open list
       - The node with lowest F is referred as the current node
     - B) Remove current node from open list, put it to the closed list
     - C) For each of the adjacent nodes to this current node (closed node)
       - If it is not walkable or if it is on the closed list, ignore it
       - If it isn't on the open list, add it to the open list. Make the current node the parent of this node. Record the F, G, and H costs of the node
       - If it is on the open list already, check to see if this path to that node is better, using G cost as the measure. A lower G cost means that this is a better path. If so, change the parent of the node to the current node, and recalculate the G and F scores of the node
         - The same scenario in Dijkstra's algorithm when an old path turns out to be better
         - If you are keeping your open list sorted by F score, you may need to resort the list to account for the change.
     - D) Stop when you:
       - Add the target square to the closed list, in which case the path has been found
       - Or, fail to find the target square, and the open list is empty. In this case, there is no path.
  3. Save the path. Working backwards from the destination node, adding each parent node to list until starting node is reached, the list of nodes represents the optimal path

#### The Travelling Salesman Problem

- It is a problem in combinatorial optimization

### Knapsack Problem

- It is a problem in combinatorial optimization
- The original problem is to maximize the value of items put in a knapsack that can only hold a certain amount of total weight, given each item has a specific weight and value

#### 0-1 Knapsack problem

- It solves a special scenario when there are only two options for each item in the defined list, ethier put it in the bag or leave it
- It is suitable to solve using dynamic programming
- A bottom-up solution is provided by drawing a table with all possible total weight for each columns and items for each row
  - For each column, the current total weight allowed is specified in the column header
  - For each row, only the item in current row and above can be used to fill the current weight
  - In each cell, find out the maximum value using the current weight and available items
  - When filling the cell, two values need to be calculated, the result if putting the current item or filling the current weight using the items from above row (directly using the value one cell above). For each of the above option, search for the possibility of add more items using the remaining weight for items in the above row and putting the max value in the current cell
- If the item index is `n`, total weight is `W`, values and weight for each item in array `v` and `w` (The array `v` and `w` are assumed to store all relevant values starting at index `1`), the example solutions for finding the max total value are shown below

  - The native recursive solution in Java that costs `O(2^n)`

  ```java
  int[] w = new int[] {1,2,3,4};
  int[] v = new int[] {2,4,7,8};
  int W = 15;
  int n = v.length;
  int knapsackRec(int n, int W) {
      if (n <= 0) {
          return 0;
      } else if (w[n - 1] > W) {
          return knapsackRec(n - 1, W);
      } else {
          return Math.max(knapsackRec(n - 1, W), v[n - 1]
            + knapsackRec(n - 1, W - w[n - 1]));
      }
  }
  ```

  - The recursive solution improved using dynamic programming that costs `O(nW)`

  ```java
  // Similar to the above code but using a temp 2D array to save and check the existing result
  int[] w = new int[] {1,2,3,4};
  int[] v = new int[] {2,4,7,8};
  int W = 15;
  int n = v.length;
  int[][] temp = new int[5][5];
  Arrays.fill(temp, -1);
  int knapsackRec(int n, int W) {
      int result;
      if (temp[n][W] != -1) return temp[n][W];
      if (n <= 0) {
          result = 0;
      } else if (w[n - 1] > W) {
          result = knapsackRec(n - 1, W);
      } else {
          result = Math.max(knapsackRec(n - 1, W), v[n - 1]
            + knapsackRec(n - 1, W - w[n - 1]));
      }
      temp[n][W] = result;
      return result;
  }
  ```

  - The bottom-up solution (as if one is drawing the `n` vs `W` table row by row) with dynamic programming that costs `O(nW)`

  ```java

    int[] wt = new int[] {1,2,3,4};
    int[] val = new int[] {2,4,7,8};
    int W = 15;
    int n = val.length;
    int knapsackBottomUp(int W, int n)
    {
      int i, w;
      int K[][] = new int[n + 1][W + 1];
      for (i = 0; i <= n; i++)
      {
        for (w = 0; w <= W; w++)
        {
          if (i == 0 || w == 0)
            K[i][w] = 0;
          else if (wt[i - 1] > w)
            K[i][w] = K[i - 1][w];
          else
            K[i][w] = Math.max(val[i - 1] + K[i - 1][w - wt[i - 1]], K[i - 1][w]);
        }
      }
      return K[n][W];
    }
  ```

  - To find the indices of item selected for the max value using filled table result

  ```java
  Set<Integer> getResultSet(int i, int j, int[][] m) {
      Set<Integer> result = new HashSet<>();
      if (i == 0) return result;
      if (m[i][j] > m[i - 1][j]) {
          result.add(i - 1); // Use the actual index of the item instead of the m table index
          result.addAll(getResultSet(i - 1, j - w[i - 1], m));
      } else {
          return getResultSet(i - 1, j, m);
      }
      return result;
  }
  ```
